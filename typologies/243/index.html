        			1 / 2:  Gare D&#39;Avignon TGV
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Avignon is a community of about 90,000 in the Provence region of France, about sixty-five miles north of Marseilles. The town center inside the historic city walls, including the Gothic Palais des Papes and the Pont d’Avignon, is a UNESCO world heritage site and the urban fabric is densely developed around the walls. In addition to a high valuation placed on the built environment of the historic city, the beauty of the natural environment is also a prized characteristic of the region.
</p>
<p>Although an 1860s era station exists just within the city, it was determined in the late 1980s that the TGV would be situated in a new station two miles south of the city. The site is rather isolated: the station’s immediate environment includes an industrial neighborhood to the north, a primary highway to the east, a river to the south, and a floodplain to the west. Connection to the city is provided by shuttle bus, though most passengers come and go by automobile. While the station has been important for regional tourism, the location of the site makes any further urban development in the area difficult. Still, the station itself is quite beautiful: fritted glass gives way to volumes of clear white sunlight, white steel and shiny concrete with long ramps up to the platforms and a high, cathedral-like ceiling.

        			2 / 2:  Estación de Albacete-Los Llanos
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Albacete is a provincial capital city of about 170,000 residents located on the Madrid–Alicante AVE high-speed rail corridor. In this corridor the high-speed route is simply an expansion of the existing conventional rail route via a widening of the right-of-way. The new station, Estación de Albacete-Los Llanos, replaced the pre-existing 1970s era station. The city is compact; though the station is situated in a peripheral location, it is still just a half-mile walk down a wide avenue, through a narrow residential zone of more contemporary multi-family housing, and across a pleasant greenway to the historic urban core. Conveniently, a long distance bus station also shares this periphery site.
</p>
<p>Los Llanos is one of a few stations in Spain (including Malaga and Salamanca) that was developed in partnership with Centro Comercial Vialia, a shopping mall operator. The station has forty-one leasable spaces for shops and cafés, a grocery store, a hotel, a ten-screen cinema, and a luxury gym in addition to the typical train station programs. While the facility is on a peripheral site, it acts largely as a destination in itself. Even so the station is designed with a very urban disposition at the street level, and will make a friendly neighbor when other buildings are developed adjacent to the station. The new commercial offerings have been embraced by the community.
