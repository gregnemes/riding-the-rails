        			1 / 4:  SHIN-YOKOHAMA STATION
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Shin-Yokohama (direct translation: New Yokohama) Station is one of the earliest examples of a high-speed rail station as a primary generator of a new urban center, though this wasn’t immediately case. The station was opened in 1964 as a part of the first Shinkansen route from Tokyo to Osaka. Due to the cost and complexity of bringing the new lines through central Yokohama, a greenfield site was chosen four miles northwest of the city under somewhat scandalous conditions. As chronicled in the Japanese novel and film “Kuro No Cho Tokkyu,” scheming real estate brokers in league with Japanese National Rail (JNR) officials and politicians actually bought up the agricultural land around the future station site on false pretenses: that a Nissan/Ford plant was to be constructed when in fact the land would be sold to JNR for the Shin-Yokohama Station.
</p>
<p>Significant development didn’t occur near the station until the late 1980s and only after other investments were made on the site, such as a metro connection to the city (the blue line in 1985), an increase in Shinkansen service frequency (the debut of Nozomi service in 1992), and concerted effort by the city to develop the area around the station as a hub. New urban development is focused in a wedge about one mile long and 1/3 mile deep to the northwest of the station, as the area southeast of the station has challenging topography more suitable for smaller scale residential neighborhoods. Further north lies the development of a major sports complex (Nissan Stadium) and new public park (Shinyokohama Park) along the river.

        			2 / 4:  GARE DE LYON PART-DIEU
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>As the second largest city in France, Lyon was the provincial capital favored for the first major TGV link with Paris. The station and station area development would become wildly successful, though the TGV station itself was not the only catalyst in this effort. In fact, in the 1970s the Lyon government was against the TGV when the link was suggested by SNCF, France's high-speed rail authority. The city had recently been named an investment target for the country's decentralization efforts, and the local government preferred the construction of an airport (now St. Exupéry, formerly known as Satolas) and a local metro over the high-speed train. Furthermore, the city was already taking steps towards development of a former urban military base (decommissioned in 1958, see 1895 map at left) into a local business district, and it was thought that a high-speed link with Paris would siphon development away from Lyon.
</p>
<p>After years of debate, and after the airport and metro were both under construction, the city acquiesced to SNCF. The freight station (which formerly served the military base) and its rail corridor were developed into one of the most successful HSR stations in the world. Lyon was already an important commercial, research, and university hub; many of the existing business with offices in greater Lyon relocated to Part-Dieu to be close to the station. According the city's website, Part-Dieu is home to some 5,000 inhabitants, 3,500 housing units, 2,000 hotel rooms, 45,000 jobs, 2,200 businesses, 10.8 million square feet with 97% occupancy, the largest urban shopping mall in Europe, and as many as half a million travelers per day. An important takeaway from this case study is that the investment in Part-Dieu as a business center was already well under way, facilitated by the construction of an efficient metro system linking to the historic center city. Later, TGV development was continued beyond the connection with Paris with service to St. Exupéry, Southern France, Switzerland, and Italy. Part-Dieu Station was an important catalyst to the development already taking place in Lyon.

        			3 / 4:  GARE DE MASSY TGV
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Massy is a suburban community of about 40,000 located ten miles south of Paris. Since the 1950s and 60s it has developed into a hub for industry and technological research: in 1983 the area was formalized by the government as “La cité scientifique, parcs et technopoles en Ile-de-France Sud.” Massy has always been well connected to Paris. The first train station opened in 1854, and there are two RER (commuter) trains that form an important suburban junction here.
</p>
<p>One might assume that the development of a high speed rail station so close to Paris would simply reinforce the condition of Massy as a bedroom community of the capital. However, the development of the Massy TGV station (one of only three TGV stations in the Paris suburbs) is not about having a quick connection to the center of Paris. In fact, use of the TGV for short trips from Massy to Montparnasse, the terminal station for this line in Paris, is not even permitted. Instead, the Massy TGV connects this important research suburb to the larger territory and to other important French cities to the south, north, and east.
</p>
<p>The area is currently dense with construction: condos and hotels and office space are the predominant mix. While foot traffic at the RER station is heavier than at the TGV station, Massy is poised to become a new urban center with transport at the center of development.
