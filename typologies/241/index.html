        			1 / 4:  TOKYO STATION
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Of all the major cities with large, historic central train stations, Tokyo Station is a category unto its own. At just over 100 years old, It is the heart of the Japanese Shinkansen network, accommodating half a million travelers every day through its connection to metro lines, commuter lines, Shinkansen high-speed lines, and airport express lines to Narita airport. It’s official name is “Tokyo Station City” in recognition of its size and importance to the city and its role as a major Japanese landmark.
</p>
<p>And the station does, in fact, operate much like a small city. The solution to lack of horizontal space for complementary programs is solved by building vertically, with skyscrapers and copious below-grade shopping. There are an amazing quantity and variety of programs, such as hotels, restaurants, gyms and spas, tourist and business centers, three office towers, a conference center, a range of shops at multiple price points, several department stores, an art museum, a large public plaza at ground level and a generous public roof terrace. The Marunouchi building (original historic structure) acts as the east entrance to the station, while two other contemporary structures (Yaesu and Nihonbashi) offer entrances at the north and west of the complex. Inside, shopping and service areas are organized into "neighborhood" type zones. If trains are a traveling microcosm of the culture that created them, Tokyo City Station is a microcosm of Japanese culture in one facility.

        			2 / 4:  ST PANCRAS INTERNATIONAL STATION
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Along with Tokyo Station, St. Pancras International is often cited as one of the world’s most beautiful train stations. This grand Victorian structure has existed since 1877, though it was taken out of operation in the mid-twentieth century and was in a sad state of disrepair. The opportunity to renovate and rehabilitate arose as the station was brought back into service as the London terminus for the HSR route to the European continent. As with Tokyo, creative design and planning within the confines of the station allowed for complementary uses to be developed during the renovations.
</p>
<p>In order to accommodate international high-speed trains and the necessary space for Eurostar international travel services, a mezzanine was constructed throughout the train shed under the famous glass and iron vaulted ceiling and a new shed extension was added to lengthen the platforms. Trains bound for Paris, Brussels, and beyond arrive on the mezzanine level, while shops, cafes, and other programs are located on the ground level tucked below the mezzanine. New underground platforms were added for regional service and a link to Luton and Gatwick airports. Further below, a major expansion and rationalization of the underground metro allows ease of access to the tube. The existing station hotel was renovated and expanded for several new levels of rooms. Even with all the additional programming, the station was intentionally designed as a public space. No ticket is needed to have a beverage and watch the trains come and go or enjoy the Victorian detailing, and the station hosts public events like a local farmer's market.

        			3 / 4:  ESTACION CENTRAL DE CORDOBA
                  </h4>
                  <div class="case-study-body serif mt2"><p>Cordoba Station is an important intermediary stop on the Madrid–Seville and Madrid/Malaga AVE routes. It is situated well within the densest part of the city, just north of the older central city. Unlike many historic cities which choose to renovate an existing historic station to receive new high-speed rail, Córdoba station was constructed as a separate new station. As a part of this effort, the existing rail corridor in the city was tunneled, offering ample opportunity above the tracks for new development of office space, housing, park space, and effectively re-connecting the north and south halves of the city.
</p>
<p>The station itself isn’t iconic, but it is elegant in a reserved way. Its east-west axis spans several blocks, and city streets cross over the platforms, which are below grade and accessible by moving ramps. A few shops, restaurants, and a ticketing area are located at the ground level, and the station is well connected to public transit. A modest parking area occupies one of the blocks, as well as two public plazas to the east and west of the building.
