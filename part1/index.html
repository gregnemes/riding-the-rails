						<h4>1.1.1</h4>
						<h3>Local Beginnings</h3>
						<p>In his book <i>The Great Railroad Revolution: The History of Trains in America</i> historian
							Christian Wolmar recounts a tale of the groundbreaking ceremony for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
							in Maryland. The date was July 4, 1828, a mere half-century since the founding of the nation.
							Turning the symbolic first shovelful of earth was Charles Carroll, the last surviving signatory of
							the Declaration of Independence. His words were direct: <i>I consider what I have just now done to
								be among the most important acts of my life, second only to signing the Declaration of
								Independence, if indeed it even be second to that.</i><em></em>
						</p>

							<blockquote>“I consider what I have just now done to be among the most important acts of my life,
								second only to signing the Declaration of Independence, if indeed it even be second to
								that.”<br><cite><em>Charles Carroll, 1828</em><br></cite>
							</blockquote>
						</figure>
						<p>This sentiment was bold but prescient. Over the next century<del>,</del> the railroad would indeed
							come to unite the individual states and catalyze the growth and settlement of a vast and
							industrious America. Yet this didn’t happen all at once. Although the great untapped expanses of
							the American West would provide fertile ground for expansion and development of railroad
							technology, in the beginning the young age of the country actually hindered growth in several ways.

						<p>A mere half-century in age, America lacked the financial capital to fund large railroad projects.
							In Great Britain the industrial revolution left the country well positioned for locomotive
							manufacturing. But in the early nineteenth century America remained largely agricultural with small
							pockets of industry burgeoning in New England. (In fact, because of Great Britain’s industrial
							advantage, iron rails for early US railroads were actually imported from there.) The young
							government was plagued by disagreements over state versus federal authority, and the railroad would
							eventually require the coordination of state and federal governments to flourish. Historian Sara
							Gordon notes that many of the founding fathers, including George Washington, championed national
							infrastructure development as a means of uniting the vast country. But many were wary of federal
							involvement in the railroads, and individual states had control over charters (which bestowed the
							necessary powers of eminent domain). Although it is hard to fathom today, some state-issued
							railroad charters in the beginning actually prohibited railroads from connecting over state lines
							due to fear of competition.

							<figcaption>Rail gauge – the distance between rail profiles – varied between railroad companies.

								to construct and maintain. Narrow gauge roads could more easily navigate mountainous topography,
								but could not support heavy loads as easily as the broader gauges. Source: Author.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>The result was a lack of coordination between railroad companies. Some opted for “standard gauge”
							tracks (an interior clear distance of 4’–8 ½”), while many southern railroads preferred a broader
							5’0” gauge, and still others opted for a more economical narrow-gauge network. Further complicating
							matters was the institutional complexity of large transportation ventures. Railroads would come to
							manage a huge variety of employees, from conductors, brakemen and firemen, to station agents and
							train-yard employees, to office secretaries and warehouse clerks. Railroads with land grants
							managed land sales and town surveying, as well as major marketing campaigns to draw settlers from
							the east coast and Europe. There was simply no precedent for corporations of this size and
							diversity. The legal system had to develop alongside the industry, and labor for the huge railroad
							construction teams was sometimes in short supply. And, of course, there was opposition from those
							invested in local canals and turnpikes.<ins></ins><br>
						</p>
						<p><em>[[slider id="111"]]</em>
						</p>
						<p>So there were hurdles to growth, which explains why, in the early years, American railroads were
							designed to solve local transportation problems. For example, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad (1826)
							had one goal: to reduce a day-long bend in the Erie Canal to an hour-long train trip. The Granite
							Railway (1826) was incorporated in Massachusetts to haul granite for the construction of the Bunker
							Hill Monument. The South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company (1827) simply connected Charleston to
							the Savannah River. During this period, the notion of a nationwide railroad network was just too
							big for most Americans—and even some railroad developers—to imagine. As such, it seems appropriate
							to begin an exploration of the spatial implications of the railroad at the smallest of scales: the
							station itself.

						</figure>
						<p><span style="line-height: 1.9;"></span>In the earliest years of the railroad, efforts towards
							innovation were not architectural. Where stations existed they were ad-hoc affairs: simple covered
							platforms or, in some cases, a nearby general store or hotel would shelter passengers waiting on
							the train. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention: as railroads expanded over time a
							great quantity of programmatic typologies were developed to cater to the needs of the train and its
							operations, employees, and passengers. Most of these new typologies borrowed their architectural
							language from existing structures of related scale and function. Most small train stations
							resembled houses, and many operations structures resembled structures found on the farms or mills
							dotting the countryside. In the beginning the architecture of the train was always familiar. The
							great height and width of the cars and locomotives, along with the limited turning radius of the
							train, however, required the horizontal and vertical proportions of the familiar house and farm
							architecture to be stretched, skewed, and pushed above or below grade. Access to the train was
							required from all sides: from the top for loading, from the side for passengers, and from below for
							servicing the locomotive and cars.

						<p><span style="line-height: 1.9;"></span><strong>Architecture for Trains and
								Operations<br></strong>In order for trains to provide safe service for passenger and freight
							travel, a variety of specialized structures were required, including: water towers, ice and sand
							houses, car sheds and cleaning yards, oil storage and mixing houses, coaling stations, ash pits,
							snow sheds and protection sheds, signal towers, section tools houses, engine houses, freight
							houses, and freight depots. See below for a gallery of selected drawings and images of these
							typologies.
						</p>
						<p>[[slider id="1121"]]
						</p>
						<p><strong>Architecture for Employees<br></strong>During construction and for safe operations,
							railroad employees were lodged along the line in section houses (dedicated to overseeing a
							“section” of the line). In some cases, railroads would also provide sleeping quarters, reading
							rooms, clubhouses, and dwelling houses. Watchman’s shanties were located at every major crossing,
							and watchmen would keep local traffic safe from oncoming trains. See below for a gallery of
							selected drawings and images of these typologies.
						</p>
						<p>[[slider id="1122"]]<br>
						</p>
						<p><strong>Architecture for Passengers<br></strong>Passenger transportation required facilities for
							buying tickets, waiting for trains, and boarding trains that were sheltered from the weather and,
							usually, removed from freight facilities. This included platforms and platforms sheds, flag depots,
							combination depots, through depots and terminal stations. Stations tended to adopt the
							architectural revivalist styles that dominated the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,
							albeit with exaggerated entrances, porches, and awnings. As small towns prospered, stations were
							rebuilt with more grandeur and prominence that reflected the importance of the train to the city's
							growth. “Union” stations replaced smaller stations in small towns with multiple railroads. See
							below for a gallery of selected drawings and images of these typologies.

						<h4>1.1.3</h4>
						<h3>Spatial Inventions and Exploitation</h3>
						<p>The most interesting architectural inventions of the railroad began to occur when companies merged,
							expanded, prospered, and greatly increased operations to the extent that buildings of an
							unprecedented scale became a necessity. New, dramatic spaces were required to serve the industry,
							such as massive waiting rooms, covered platform halls of great vertical and horizontal dimension,
							ticket sales with queuing logic, efficient luggage processing, circulation halls with timetable
							displays (and the resulting international phenomena of crowds standing in a big room looking at a
							screen). Large railroads spared no expense at their terminal stations in large cities, with some
							taking on the civic role of a modern cathedral: the most impressive meeting space in the city, with
							vaulted ceilings, impressive construction materials, and cutting edge structural technology.
						</p>
						<p>[[slider id="1131"]]<br>
						</p>
						<p>Moreover, stations began to absorb new and expanded programs to serve passengers and become civic
							destinations, even for those not travelling. Stations typically hosted newsagents and bookstores,
							shoe cleaners and hairdressers, drug stores and soda fountains, shops and diners, and even fine
							restaurants.
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>1.1.4</h4>
						<h3>New Landmarks and "Progress"</h3>
						<p>Nearly every important city across the world has at least one magnificent train station. These
							structures took on the role of gateways to the city, edifices of progress, and a reflection of
							urban pride, all while celebrating the railway companies that built them. Journalists used language
							usually reserved for religious architecture to describe these stations, such as “temples of
							transportation” and “cathedrals of steam" or "cathedrals of progress."

						<p>More than just opulent structures, train stations were one of the few truly democratic structures
							in the city. Historian Derek Boles elaborates: <i>Unlike other monuments to distinctive
								architecture such as courthouses, department stores, cathedrals, bank lobbies, theatres and
								skyscrapers, the grand rail terminals were open to everyone. They were truly public buildings
								where all classes could mingle. On their way to and from the trains, the rich and famous passed
								through the same gates and walked along the same concrete platforms as the impoverished
								immigrant.</i> The invention of transportation - accessible to the public in centralized
							industrial cathedrals - reinforced America's democratic culture.
						</p>
						<p>The centralized station created an urban nexus upon which all classes converged. Author George
							Douglas captures the vibrancy of the station in the Victorian Age: <i>…the railroad terminal was
								also somehow a microcosm of city life; scarcely another single place could make such a claim
								since the city by its very definition seemed to allow no small model of itself, no place where
								its essence could be summed up. But here in the great railroad terminal, one could see on
								display everything that made social life tick: urgency, mobility, response to desire and
								aspiration, standards of dress, habits of thought, peculiarities of speech, ebb and flow, joy
								and sorrow, motion and emotion, parting and reunion. </i>Even today, many train stations,
							whether small and simple or large and opulent, are places of intense and varied human activity.

						<p>In many European countries, the development of the railroad occurred within a context of urban
							centers that were well established, many having existed for hundreds of years. The train served to
							link city to city, or the city to some productive hinterland to bring crops and livestock to
							market. But at the dawn of the railroad in America, much of the country remained an inaccessible
							frontier occupied by smaller Native American populations regarded as foreign nations. Good roads
							were in scarce supply, and the cost of transporting crops to far-away markets was high. Subsistence
							farming was the norm, and industrial scale enterprise for mining, timber, agriculture, or livestock

						<p>In this context, the train became an agent of development that transformed the country. At the
							scale of the city, the train remade existing urban environments and created new towns with a focus
							on the station as a center and the most important civic space. Although the train had considerable
							economic and physical implications for existing cities like New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and
							Chicago, the following sections are dedicated to the consideration of towns and territories
							produced almost entirely by the railroad industry itself, specifically the Illinois Central
							Railroad (ICRR) as the first private company given a federal land grant to construct and operate a
							railroad in the United States.

						<h4>1.2.1</h4>
						<h3>Illinois Central Railroad Charter and "The Associates"</h3>
						<p>In 1850, President Millard Fillmore signed an act providing for the creation of a railroad to
							connect Chicago and the Great Lakes to Mobile and the Gulf of Mexico through the states of
							Illinois, Mississippi, and Alabama. To raise funds for the construction of the line, even-numbered
							sections of land six miles on each side of the route were granted from the federal government to
							the state (and eventually to a state-chartered railroad company). Where a section of land wasn't
							available to the company within the twelve-mile buffer, due to existing development or previous
							settlement, any available section of land within fifteen miles of the route could be taken. To
							compensate for it's real estate loss, the federal government raised the price of the remaining
							odd-numbered sections within the twelve-mile buffer from $1.25 an acre to $2.50 an acre.

						</figure>
						<p>To prevent the railroad from profiting too deeply on the land, an amendment to the act forbade the
							chartered company to lay out towns on their own sections of land, as town sites would bring a much
							higher selling price than agricultural land. This stipulation was later rescinded in 1855, to the
							extent that the ICRR could plat towns at “such points on the (line) where their depots are already
							located and established.” (There is some evidence that the railroad did, in fact, lay out towns
							before this date—they simply waited to register the plats with the county until it was legal to do
							so.) Still, the initial existence of the restriction on laying out towns paved the way for four of
							the original directors of the ICRR to turn a profit outside of the company itself. David Neal,
							George Griswold, Jonathan Sturges, and Morris Ketchum, together with R. B. Mason, the engineer in
							charge of construction, formed a company called the “Land Associates” to purchase key odd-numbered
							sections of land from the federal government. Because the men had advance knowledge of the final
							route through Illinois, and influence over the location of depots and stations on odd-numbered
							sections, they stood to make a great deal of money from the sale of parcels in the new towns. This
							form of unscrupulous land grab is a constant threat to large public works, especially when they are
							developed and operated by private consortiums.

						<p>In the early 1800s Illinois’ urban form drew inspiration from many sources. A river would almost
							always inspire long, narrow parcels at its edge, giving each owner direct access to the waters edge
							for shipping. Topographical conditions would require consideration, such as a shift in the urban
							fabric or a road that followed the contours of the countryside. The organization of land into
							townships and sections distributed ownership into shapes like rectangles and squares that were
							aligned with the cardinal directions. As such, the most efficient layouts were grids organized
							along the same axes, though the size and proportion of the streets and blocks varied widely from
							town to town. Importantly, many were laid out around a shared, central public space: a square or
							plaza or park that would host gatherings, markets, and festivals. Towns were created by
							aggregation, platted by anyone who owned the land according to his vision of American urbanism.
							This tended to produce city forms that, although familiar in their overall organization, remained
							nuanced and idiosyncratic—a manifestation of the local imaginary.

						<p>Unlike pre-railroad towns that formed “organically,” through the actions of local citizens and in

							mindset as the railroad itself. The Land Associates led the way with a literal “urban template,” a

							plan ready to be filled in by the surveyor.

						<p>The Associates' town design is distinct in several important aspects. Although the layout of most
							Illinois towns adhered to the grid of the Land Ordinance of 1785 for efficiency, the Associates’
							plat instead oriented the grid to the line. The railroad became the spine of the city, and all
							development happened outward from that geometry. On both sides of the tracks, the land was divided
							into a grid of 320' x 400' blocks that present their long side to the tracks, privileging
							circulation in the same direction as the trains. Parallel to the tracks, generous streets with a
							70’ clear right-of-way are named after American tree species, such as Chestnut, Oak, Walnut, and
							Locust. Narrower 40’ wide alleys split the blocks. Perpendicular to the tracks, the 70’ wide
							streets are numbered, increasing in both directions from the center: North First Street and South
							First Street flank the station, creating a “ground zero” for the town. The parcels are narrower
							near the station, only 40’ wide, adding density and diversity along the streets fronting the
							tracks.

						<p>Traditionally, the center of the town was a park, plaza, or other shared public open space that

						</figure>
						<p>By charter, the railroad was granted 100' on each side of the line for the main tracks, side
							tracks, and operating area. Although the station was the center of the town, this 200' wide swath
							created a substantial separation through railroad towns that never occurred in earlier towns.
							Further dividing the city, the Associates' standard plat indicates a freight depot on one side of
							the tracks and a passenger depot on the other. More than simply shifting the central focus of the
							town, the two stations established an inherent bias to these towns: one side of the tracks caters
							to warehouses, light manufacturing, and other freight-oriented uses, and the other caters to shops,
							and traveler-oriented uses. Passengers were reluctant to cross the dangerous railroad right-of-way,
							so most commercial businesses preferred to locate on the station side of town. In other words, the
							“wrong side of the tracks” is built into the urban template through both function and physical
							separation. Lower income citizens congregated on the less welcoming, more industrialized, and
							sometimes-toxic side of town.

						<p>The Associates would profit from the sale of real estate, but the railroad would profit from the
							traffic—passenger and freight—that came to the town for the train. As noted by Richard O. Davies
							and Joseph A. Amato: <i>It was not an ingrained belief in the virtues of urban design that led to a
								mapped prefiguration of a town, but rather an imperative to control development.</i> Therefore,
							the urban template privileges efficiency and circulation over the station as a civic amenity of a
							lived-in environment. Naturally, varying conditions surrounding each new town required the
							Associates’ standard plat to be modified to suit each location. For example, the rotated grid that
							followed the line created flatiron parcels at the section edges. To adjust the standard template,
							the Associates marked each plat with pencil and yellow ink as a record of these modifications. The
							back of each plat contains a hand sketch of the odd-numbered section, indicating which portions
							were to be sold as farmland and in what proportions. See below for selected examples of the
							Associates’ 1850s plat book, county records of town layouts, and contemporary aerial photos of each
							location.

						<p>Throughout the nineteenth century towns connected to the railroad thrived while others faded and,
							in some cases, disappeared entirely. Collectively, these prosperous railroad towns determined a
							vision of American civic modernity for the age. Although the Associates only platted seventeen
							towns, the influence of their urban design extended far beyond the edges of those towns. The formal
							attributes of their template are clearly visible in other locations. This is especially true of the
							forty-one towns platted by the ICRR after the restriction prohibiting the railroad from developing
							town sites was lifted. The ICRR reproduced the Associates' unique grid rotation, block size, parcel
							distribution, street widths and naming convention, the disposition of the freight and passenger
							stations and architectural celebration of the city in the form of a depot or station, and the
							conspicuous absence of shared civic space in the form of parks and plazas.

						<p>These elements came to inform the look and feel of what was considered a modern, progressive city.

							exhibited an important functional shift from the towns of the 18th century. Rather than independent
							poles of culture and trade catering to homesteaders, towns became nodes in a larger network of
							capitalistic enterprise. As the landscape was transformed for industrial scale resource production

						<p>Continuing with the use of Illinois as a case study: in the early 1800s much of the land in the
							state was unsettled by Europeans and largely inaccessible. Residents clustered near cities situated
							on navigable waterways for accessibility, and many areas were swampy and in need of drainage.
							Subsistence farming was the norm, because trade was conducted locally and markets for the purchase
							of farm products were small. (In 1850, only one of every 131 acres of land in the counties later
							traversed by the ICRR in Iowa were under cultivation. In 1929, 1 out of every 1 1/2 acres was under
							cultivation.) Roads were rare, and when they existed at all they were rarely well maintained. A
							north-south trip through the state might take several weeks to complete. News traveled slowly, and
							the friction of travel was high; cities that were close geographically were still weeks apart by
							travel. For most purposes—communication, culture, commerce, etc.—territories in the 1800s were
							geographically small, but temporally large.<ins></ins>

						<h3>The Spatial Implications of Steam Engine Technology</h3>
						<p>Transportation technology has important and idiosyncratic spatial implications. In later centuries
							the car would cater to its own needs in remaking the urban environments established by the train:
							highways and access ramps would slice through cities, buildings would be replaced by parking lots,
							and streets would be widened to increase lanes of traffic at the expense of the pedestrian realm.
							In the same way, the railroad made, and remade, the built environment in its own image throughout
							the 1800s.

						</figure>
						<p>The steam engine itself was almost like a living being; Walt Whitman referred to it as a
							"fierce-throated beauty." Thick clouds of steam and smoke shot straight up into the sky, powering
							hundreds of visible parts clamoring in syncopation to propel the machine forward. Movement was
							rhythmic and musical: the stack snorted and huffed steam, and the whistle pierced the air in a
							high-pitch squeal or a low, bellowing moan. Each locomotive had its own ticks and quirks and, like
							ships, many were given unique names. The steam engine required fuel and water at fairly frequent
							intervals. Outside of any local or topographical considerations, supply stops are the most basic
							physical implication train.<ins></ins> <em></em>

						</figure>
						<p>The engine consumed fuel non-stop at a rate based on the size of the engine, the operating speed,
							the general topography, and the combined weight of the train, freight, and passengers. In the early
							years, locomotives would stop to refill the tender (the car directly behind the engine to hold wood
							or coal) as frequently as every 100–125 miles. Water would be required at five to seven mile
							intervals, though eventually larger on-board water tanks extended the running distance. The engine
							would need oiled, inspected, and maintained about every 125 miles, which became a standard length
							for a railroad division.
						</p>
						<p>Not every water stop would necessitate a town site. Often a simple water tower and track siding
							would meet the demands of the steam engine. But often there was a town site at these locations for
							other reasons. First, the Land Ordinance of 1785 surveyed a good portion of the US into
							thirty-six-square-mile townships: six miles on each side. Local desire for a station in each
							township, coupled with the pragmatic need for water and fuel, gave rise to many "flag-stop" towns
							with freight and sometimes passenger depots. Finally, towns were spaced to intensely develop
							agricultural resources and establish local operating economies.

						<p>Steam engine technology had implications on spatial development patterns, but place and culture
							also had an effect on the design of the train itself. In the US, the most abundant form of fuel in
							the nineteenth century was wood. When burned for fuel in a steam engine, hot embers could escape
							through the exhaust and fall smoldering to the ground, thus endangering the unsettled land near the
							line with wildfires. American wood-burning locomotives therefore opted for a diamond shaped stack
							(exhaust chimney) to contain sparks and embers that could cause a fire. Coal was more common
							throughout Europe, so the diamond shaped stack became a uniquely American feature. Similarly, a
							triangular steel grating called a “pilot” (or a “cowcatcher”) was often installed on American
							locomotives to knock any obstacles on the tracks away from the train. [The vastness of the American
							West meant that deer, bison, and yes, cows, wandered onto the tracks frequently enough to demand a
							catcher.] In England, railroads were typically protected with fencing along the line, so pilots
							were not common.<ins></ins>

						<h3>Route Selection</h3>
						<p>ICRR's federal charter gave a general directive for a route with two branches, connecting: <i>the
								southern terminus of the Illinois and Michigan Canal to a point at or near the junction of the
								Ohio and Mississippi rivers, with a branch of the same to Chicago on Lake Michigan, and another,
								via the town of Galena, in said state, to Dubuque, in the state of Iowa</i>. The specific route
							was such a politically charged issue that the charter was purposefully vague. The railroad company
							had much of the power to determine the specific route. Thus, there were several key economic and
							engineering factors that influenced the ICRR's delineation of the perfect route.
						</p>

						</figure>
						<p>First, the railroad should maximize its potential profit by selecting a route through areas that
							would offer the most traffic to the company. That meant choosing areas with the greatest natural
							resources of timber, agriculture, minerals, and the like.
						</p>
						<p>Second, as stipulated in the charter, the ICRR could not take land from existing owners, nor could
							it compensate by taking sections further than fifteen miles from the route. Selecting a route
							through areas that were already settled with small to mid-size towns or established farms was a far
							less desirable option than a route through unsettled land. Exceptions were made for substantial
							cities with thriving industry, such as Bloomington, Clinton, Decatur, Freeport, Dixon, Galena, La
							Salle, Mendota, and Vandalia.
						</p>
						<p>Third, the route should be economical to construct. That meant no expensive rights of way, or long
							bridges, viaducts, or tunnels, or routes that would require extensive grading. Where challenging
							topography existed, the route follows the natural contours of the landscape rather than enlisting
							expensive civil engineering projects.<ins></ins>
						</p>
						<p>Finally, routes that would involve a high level of maintenance for operation and safety, such as
							grades and curves, were to be avoided. See below for a timeline of the ICRR railroad construction,
							including an estimation of the land sales over time created with data from the Illinois secretary
							of state and ICRR historical records.

						<p>Railroad executives accurately predicted that the bulk of their business would come from long-haul

							would result in lower business at each one. Too few towns or elevators would result in lost
							business, or leave room in the market for another rail line to become competitive. Sometimes a town
							or group of farmers would develop a branch line independent of the major railroad companies. These
							were often called short lines.

						<p>John C Hudson lays out the economies of space and scale for farmers in the mid-1800s: <i>Wheat
								yields...averaged between ten and twenty bushels per acre. Taking the midpoint of that range,
								the output of a quarter section of land would be twenty wagonloads of grain. If the elevator
								were no more than eight miles away, a farmer could make one round trip in a day, including
								loading, hauling, waiting, unloading, and returning to his farm. Twenty days of work for
								marketing a quarter section of wheat at a distance of eight miles would become roughly forty
								days if the elevator were far enough away so that he could not complete a round trip in one
								day.<ins></ins></i><em></em>
						</p>
						<p>In some instances, to preserve the ideal station spacing the railroad would refuse to install a
							switch along the route even if a settlement was already built up. Such was the case in 1854 for the
							small town of Luro, and many of the storekeepers moved their stores to nearby Oconee where the ICRR
							platted a town the next year. Similarly, rather than altering the optimal route to incorporate the
							existing town of Jonesboro, the ICRR simply developed Anna, a new town, one mile east.

						<h3>New Operative Territories of Communication, Culture, and Commerce</h3>
						<p>The construction of the ICRR and other railroads initiated a massive temporal compression of
							traditional territorial extents. Previously inaccessible land was now open to settlement from the
							outside: farming and livestock, mining, logging, and other industries could now be freely developed
							to industrial scales. H. Roger Grant documented a nineteenth century observation: <i>Before the
								coming of railways corn could not be sold or given away in many sections and it literally rotted
								in the cribs.</i><em></em>
						</p>
						<figure data-type="quote" class="wy-figure-small wy-figure-left">
							<blockquote>"The railroad was a steel straw through which resources were drawn into the city."<br>
								<cite>Tom Zoellner</cite>
							</blockquote>
						</figure>
						<p>In 1853, an Alabama newspaper noted: <em>This is an evidence of the value of railroads. This timber
								is brought from a section of the country, four years ago impenetrable, and these trees as they
								then stood were worthless.</em> The train increased the value of natural resources and labor,
							because settlers could ship their goods at a low cost to a geographically expanded buyer’s market.
						</p>
						<p>Moreover, processors and manufacturers now had access to a geographically expanded consumer
							territory. The increased volume of trade reduced unit prices on a range of products, making them
							attainable at lower costs. This sparked a consumerism for finished goods, like hard coal, finished
							lumber, cut nails, and processed foods. The reduced cost of transportation and unit costs ushered
							in the Gilded Age: farmers found a buyer for their corn, and manufacturers found customers for
							their corn flakes. A railroad executive captured the massive changes: <em>By steam power all the
								various products of the earth are rapidly, and with trifling expense, centered in the same spot.
								Under these influences the old relations of society are rapidly disappearing, and the new ones
								are taking their place. Tradition is fast losing power over the hands of man.</em>

						</figure>
						<p>The notion of standardizing time has its roots in the establishment of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in
							1675, when the British Royal Observatory was constructed. Before the widespread development of the
							railroad, time was a local matter. GMT was used mostly to assist mariners in determining their
							longitude while at sea. Towns throughout England kept their local times and simply used GMT as a
							reference. It was determined by the sun above, or by a shared, dependable public clock tower. But
							small temporal discrepancies were inconvenient or dangerous for train travel: without a shared
							system within and between railroad companies, crashes at line crossings and missed connections at
							stations were inevitable. Each line kept its own time, usually along the meridian of its
							originating station or an important terminus.
						</p>
						<p>In his essay "The Economics of Time Zones," Matthew White states the problem: <i>By one estimate,
								in the 1870s there were some 8,000 individual local time conventions being kept by towns and
								communities across the nation. Abandoning this local time system was inconceivable—as late as
								1882, a U.S. Senate report on this haphazard state of affairs concluded that “it would appear to
								be as difficult to alter by edict the ideas and habits of the people in regard to local time as
								it would be to introduce among them a novel system of weights, measures, volumes and money.”</i>
							Local time not only created a shared temporal sense, but also the sense of local community: one
							that abided by a shared and idiosyncratic time determined by a centrally located clock tower or
							church bell. Resistance to standardization was resistance to outside interference.<em></em>

						</figure>
						<p>Still, around the mid-point of the nineteenth century the notion of standardizing time started to

							Time Convention (GTC) in 1872, which established general agreements between companies regarding
							methods of safe operation within the variety of local time conventions. These agreements were
							workable for many years, over which period a variety of time zone solutions were proposed to the
							railroads.

						<p>Charles F. Dowd, a school principal from Saratoga, NY, created a proposal for time zones across the
							United States in strict fifteen-degree wedges. His idea was that only the railroads would use this
							new timekeeping system, while local time would prevail in the towns. To mitigate the time
							discrepancies, Dowd created a complex almanac that calculated the differences between local and
							standard times for thousands of cities along hundreds of railroad lines throughout America.

						</figure>
						<p>The proposal that was eventually adopted by the railroads is largely credited to William F. Allen,
							the leader of a prominent railroad trade association. In his proposal, the rigorous fifteen-degree
							time zone wedges are skewed and morphed to incorporate the major terminus stations of the railroad.
							White elaborates: <i>The meridians indexing these zones were not of overriding interest to the
								practical-minded members of the GTC, however. In defining the zones, what railway managers
								valued highly was a system that minimized their switching costs—that is, a plan that altered
								existing time division breaks between railways as little as possible. Drawing upon existing
								railway maps, Allen proposed a system that fit the new zone boundaries to the termini of the
								railways. The Eastern and Central zones, for example, met at Pittsburgh, where the Pennsylvania
								Railroad’s two divisions had long switched from "Philadelphia time" to "Columbus time." Allen’s
								plan was designed so that no railroad would have to reprint schedules or change running times.
								Most would simply have to reset their clocks and watches a few minutes.</i><em></em>

							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Thus, November 18, 1883 became known as the "Day of Two Noons." Across the US time balls fell once
							and then were reset to fall a second time at the new noon, an adjustment for what would quickly be
							known as Railway Standard Time. (Time balls were mechanical devices located on spires atop
							important buildings that “dropped” every day from precisely 12:00PM to 12:01PM. Citizens would
							reset their own timepieces by them.) Seventy of the one hundred most important railroad terminus
							cities changed their times that day, and most others did soon after. Although congress did not
							officially adopt the railroads' time zone standards until 1918, Railway Standard Time became the de
							facto rule across the country.
						</p>
						<p>When comparing the various time conventions, Dowd's proposal is the antithesis of the hyper-local
							timekeeping conventions of his age: his scientifically-rigorous time wedges exhibit no concern for
							administrative boundaries, the idiosyncrasies of natural topography and hydrology, or the railroad
							companies' operational boundaries. Perhaps these limitations could be overlooked if the system
							greatly simplified the complexities of mediating the pre-existing hyper-local times conventions.
							But the complex translational almanac required to mediate the time discrepancies was impractical.
							Allen's system takes guidance from the scientifically rigorous fifteen-degree wedges of Dowd's (and
							others') proposal, but the boundaries are adjusted to cater to the major operational boundaries of
							the railroad. As described in the official map (above), time zone is indicated as colored railroad
							lines, not shaded regions. As such the map suggests that system did not require that every city
							adjust to Railway Standard Time. Still, the majority did, and this reflects the increasing
							importance of standardization at urban and territorial scales.

						<p>An essay titled “The Past and Future” published in the American Railroad Journal in 1855 captured
							the spirit of the age: <i>It is impossible for any mind, however capacious and enlightened, to form
								anything like an adequate conception of what the railway in the next century may achieve</i>.
							And, indeed, over the next century the railroad would effect development in every inch of the built
							environment and patterns of living in every corner of the nation.
						</p>
						<p>At the turn of the century the railroad was the only practical method of interstate travel. To
							regulate an industry without any feasible competition, the Hepburn Act of 1906 gave authority to
							the new Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to regulate the railroads' passenger fares and freight
							shipment charges. In addition, the ICC forbade these companies from discontinuing passenger service
							when competition from cars and jets became more prominent.<br>
						</p>
						<p>The 1930s saw the peak of railroad mileage in the US, and in subsequent decades overall mileage and
							service declined. In 1929 there were over 20,000 passenger trains in daily use. By 1970 that
							quantity was down to 500. Automobiles became more commonplace and affordable. The Federal Highway
							Act of 1956 created thousands of miles of shiny new highways for those autos, and personal
							commuting and the trucking industry thrived. The Housing Act of 1949 paved the way for suburban
							home ownership, reinforcing the automobile as the primary means of transportation. The airline
							industry also expanded and became more affordable. Given the vast geographical expanse of the
							country, a plane ride often made more sense for time economy. There was an overwhelming shift in
							the way people traveled, but also in the way they lived, worked, and played. Modernity left the
							train behind.

							<figcaption>Most railroads merged into one of four main railroad conglomerates. Source: Trains
								Magazine.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>In the coal-rich Northeast the shift to oil-sourced energy also took a toll on rail business.
							Throughout the mid-century railroads responded to developing conditions by merging with other roads
							and reducing passenger service. One such merger, approved by congress in 1968, allowed the joining
							of two competing lines in the Northeast: The Pennsylvania and the New York Central. For many
							reasons this was a disastrous decision and by 1970 Penn Central applied for bankruptcy. Similar to
							the auto industry bailout in 2010, the government was faced with the situation of a railroad too
							big to fail, and too flawed to attract any buyers. Thus the railroad crisis presented itself on two
							fronts—acutely with the failure of Penn Central in the Northeast, and more generally with the
							national decline of passenger rail services.
						</p>
						<p>The solution was presented and acted upon quickly by the Nixon administration. Amtrak was formed to
							take over passenger rail services from the thirteen largest railroads, and Conrail was formed from
							the former Penn Central, as well as other bankrupt lines, to revitalize freight operations in the
							Northeast and Midwest.

						</figure>
						<p>Over time, Conrail proved to be very successful. The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 provided
							deregulation of the railroads (the rates for which had been fixed by the ICC since the beginning of
							the century when railroads were the only feasible method of cross country transport) and marked a
							turnaround in profitability. According to Conrail: <em>The Staggers Act made railroads more
								competitive with trucks by allowing them to price services, adjust rail rates, react to market
								conditions, and provide special contracts.</em> Conrail was eventually purchased jointly by
							Norfolk Southern and CSX, thus returning the track, rolling stock, and operations to the private
							sector. It is generally considered a success story for timely government intervention to revitalize
							a failing industry.
						</p>
						<p>Amtrak, however, is another story.

						</figure>
						<p>National passenger rail service began in 1971, and in nearly every aspect, it has had significant
							challenges. Amtrak's inherited passenger cars and locomotives from the same companies that had been
							uninterested in investing in passenger rail for decades and were naturally dated and in poor
							repair. It owned very few rail corridors outside of the Northeast, and the ones it did own were in
							shockingly terrible conditions. It had little means for substantial improvements for infrastructure
							or rolling stock.
						</p>
						<p>Funding for Amtrak was, and continues to be, minimal. American cultural perception demands that the
							railroad be financially solvent, with no subsidy. However, no other transportation system in the US
							(or the world, for that matter) exists without public subsidy. US highways and airports receive
							much more government assistance, with much less criticism, than Amtrak. Moreover, low funding made,
							and continues to make, true investment in infrastructure and rolling stock impossible. Profitable
							routes in the Northeast subsidize lower profit routes instead of reinvesting in infrastructure
							improvements, which could improve service in the denser parts of the US.

						<p>Another challenge is the geography and low-density urban patterns of America, which are not ideal
							for robust passenger service. On many routes, service is limited to once a day or even just three
							times a week. Current travel times on some routes are longer than they were in 1970. Hurricane
							Katrina shut down service from New Orleans to Florida in 2005, and it has never been reinstated.

						<p>In some ways Amtrak has been successful. The route from Washington to New York City carries 70% of

						<p>As we turn our attention from the past to the present it is worthwhile to draw some conclusions
							from the research presented in Part 1, and in doing so establish a perspective for the study into
							contemporary applications of high-speed rail in Part 2.<br>
						</p>
						<p>The importance of the railroad to the form and shape of early America (physically, economically,
							culturally, and socially) cannot be overstated. The train galvanized an American spirit of
							entrepreneurship, individualism, progress, and technological determinism towards an urbanism
							specific to the physical and temporal parameters of the railroad. The train and its station seeded
							an urbanism distinct from later modular pairs, such as the jet and the airport, or even a car and a
							highway. While these other mobility technologies would also come to inform American urbanism in the
							twentieth century, the implications of the train have been embedded in the physical, economic,
							social, and cultural DNA of the country well before the car and the plane and in ways that the
							collective American imagination has forgotten.
						</p>
						<p>Sometimes it takes a fresh eyes to observe that which is most obvious. French philosopher John Paul
							Sartre’s travel essays, written during a trip to the US in the 1940s, document the importance of
							the railroad to the generation of form in American cities:
						</p>
						<p><i>In order to learn to live in these cities and to like them as Americans do, I had to fly over
								the immense deserts of the west and south. Our European cities, submerged in human countrysides
								that have been worked over mile by mile, are continuous...We flew for hours between New Orleans
								and San Francisco, over an earth that was dry and red, clotted with verdigris bushes. Suddenly,
								a city, a little checkerboard flush with the ground, arose and then, again, the red earth, the
								Savannah, the twisted rocks of the Grand Canyon, and the snows of the Rocky Mountains.<br> <br>
								After a few days of this diet, I came to understand that the American city was, originally, a
								camp in the desert. People from far away, attracted by a mine, a petroleum field or fertile
								land, arrived one fine day and settled as quickly as possible in a clearing, near a river. They
								built the vital parts of the town, the bank, the town hall, the church, and then hundreds of
								one-story frame houses. The road, if there was one, served as a kind of spinal column to the
								town, and then streets were marked out like vertebrae, perpendicular to the road. It would be
								hard to count the American cities that have that kind of parting in the middle.</i>
						</p>
						<p>Like the US, many countries in Europe and Asia have a deep spatial and economic history with the
							railroad. But unlike the US, nineteenth century Europe, and to a lesser extent Asia, were already
							significantly developed. There, hundreds or thousands of years of self-sufficiency informed the
							development of architecture, public spaces, urban morphologies, regional distributions of cities,
							and territorial relationships. Conversely, in post-frontier America, the hinterlands were
							immediately and fully plugged into a vast network of capitalist enterprise made possible by the
							railroad. Paris, London, Brussels, Madrid, Berlin, Tokyo, Beijing, and countless other cities were
							established as important urban centers before the American continent was even encountered by the
							rest of the world. As such, while in the US the conventional railroad produced new cities and
							patterns of urban development, in Europe and Asia the train acted as a disruptor, an agent of
							change and modernity within centuries-old cities. In the same travel essay, Sartre describes
							European cities to be “closed cities, full as eggs” while American cities are “formless and
							unfinished…haunted by the immense geographical space surrounding them.”
						</p>
						<p>By the early twentieth century the golden age of the railroad in the United States had begun to
							wane. New trends in mobility, patterns of living, and national policies towards investment in
							highway building, aviation, and suburban homeownership aligned to hasten the demise of passenger
							rail in the US. Although the railroad network is still key for freight transportation, as many as
							98% of Americans have never ridden an inter-city train. Those who have are using Amtrak, which
							struggles with the dominance of freight on shared tracks, systemic federal underfunding, and poor
							service frequency, among other issues that reinforce the notion of the train as a relic of the
							past, not a foundation for the future.
						</p>
						<p>In most European and Asian countries, post-WWII investment in transportation included the railroad:
							subways, commuter rail, intercity rail, even national and international railroad networks.
							Beginning with Japan in the 1960s, carried on by France and Germany throughout the 70s, 80s, and
							90s, and implemented more recently by Spain, China, and South Korea, these investments were
							increasingly made towards new and upgraded networks for high-speed trains. In Part 2, we’ll examine
							high-speed rail in a variety of cultural contexts and from large scale to small scale. Of equal
							importance to the innovative methods deployed by designers to incorporate HSR into historic urban
							centers is the invention of rural and suburban HSR stations, and the new operative scales offered
							by the train’s high speeds. When distance is measured in minutes, not miles, the imperative of
							regional planning challenges the American tradition of planning (and governance) confined to city
							limits.
						</p>
						<p>Perhaps most importantly, the case studies introduce an imaginary of the train as contemporary
							rather than nostalgic. In the US the train is a past. As Dana Frank writes: <i>Trains tap into some
								deep American collective memory.</i> Its relevance is tied to the gold rush, the settling of the
							West, or at best, the moan of a distant freight train at night. Or, in a more contemporary vision,
							of the inconstant silver Amtrak stranded on a side track waiting for freight trains to barrel
							passed. In Europe and Asia, the image of a sleek train zipping quietly through the city and country
							is cleaner, more progressive, and more hopeful than any other mode of transit—it is inextricably
							linked to a vision of the future.
