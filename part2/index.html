						<h3>The Evolution of Representations of Distance and Time</h3>
						<p>Part
							1 of
							<i>Riding the Rails</i> ended with a
							discussion of nineteenth century representation techniques specific to a
							shrinking world, so it seems appropriate to begin Part 2 with a discussion of twentieth
							century techniques and a personal foray into twenty-first century techniques.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>The "annihilation of space” was a common expression used in the nineteenth century to conceptualize
							the changes being wrought by the railroad. Though commonly attributed to Karl Marx, Alexander Pope
							first used the expression in a poem, lamenting, “Ye Gods! Annihilate but space and time, And make
							two lovers happy.” Throughout the twentieth century writers and philosophers began to describe the
							social, economic, and spatial implications of new mobility technologies: not just trains, but
							aircraft and communications technologies as well. Donald Janelle first coined the term “time-space
							convergence” to discuss the ways in which different places around the world were actually closer to
							each other than they used to be—maybe not as measured in miles, but certainly in minutes. The
							impetus for this idea was borrowed from Einstein’s theories on relativity in the mid-twentieth
							century, which challenged the traditional Newtonian idea that position and space are absolute:
							<em>In modern physics and philosophy, distance is no longer considered a universally valid
								parameter for describing the relationship between points, events, or particles in space. For the
								physicist to describe such relationships, it is necessary that he view them in time-space and
								that he knows their positions, their velocities, and the direction in which they are
								moving.</em>
						</p>
						<p><em></em>Janelle’s
							work on time-space convergence suggests that “four inextricably linked
							dimensions (three dimensions of space and one of time)”, means that we should
							no longer think of time and space as separate phenomena, but instead as a unified
							concept “time-space.”

							<figcaption>David Harvey's time-space compression map.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Later
							in the late twentieth century, social philosopher and geographer David Harvey
							coined the term "time-space compression" to capture this sense of
							overwhelming change in the very dimensions of space and time. Although his work
							focuses on economics and capitalism, he produced a map to highlight the
							historical eras and their mobility technologies that have contributed to
							time-space compression. The earth is shown growing proportionally smaller as
							speeds increase, and the map optimistically treats time-space compression
							evenly across the globe. For example, in this map Africa is being pulled as
							closely to America as Europe in units of time. Yet we know in practice that
							most places in Africa remain quite remote, geographically and temporally, and
							certainly much further than Europe from America. While the world may be
							shrinking, it isn’t shrinking uniformly.
						</p>
						<figure data-type="quote" class="wy-figure-medium wy-figure-right">
							<blockquote>While the world may be shrinking, it isn’t shrinking uniformly.<br>

							</blockquote>
						</figure>
						<p>Ideas such as time-space convergence and time-space compression challenge the hegemony of
							geographic distance in cartography, though cartographers have only just begun to experiment with
							maps that privilege relativity over absolute distance. One example of such a representation is a
							form of cartogram often called an anamorphic map. A cartogram is a type of map in which some
							variable distorts the areas (area cartograms) or distances (distance cartograms) of the map. This
							distortion of area or distance is intended to convey important thematic variables of concern, such
							as time-space compression.
						</p>
						<p>Japanese graphic artist Kohei Sugiura produced an early example of anamorphic maps dealing with
							time-space compression in the late 1960s. As in the nineteenth century, Sugiura’s topic for
							studying the spatial implications of time-space compression is the railroad: this time the
							technologically superior <i>Shinkansen</i> in Japan. He created maps and diagrams at many different
							scales, from the city to the globe, but the most popular diagram is that of the distortion of the
							Japanese archipelago after the introduction of the Shinkansen in 1960.

						</figure>
						<p>Suguira’s maps are rather violent, suggesting an upheaval of land that is egocentrically
							reorganized around a fixed point. The familiar shape of the archipelago is warped and compressed,
							sculpted into the silhouette of an alien flower. When one presupposes absolute distance as a given,
							the map is simply a scaled tracing of the ground condition and, therefore, is naturally static. But
							when relative distance is the presupposition, the ground plane is twisted, skewed, and warped to
							reflect travel time from a particular starting point.

						<p>While
							the Shinkansen anamorphic maps were laboriously created by hand, continuous
							developments in technology have made the creation of these cartograms much
							easier. In the example below, created by the author, the country of Spain is
							rendered through the lens of a series of transportation modes: a typical car
							journey at 9:00AM on a Monday in 2015, a typical AVE high-speed train journey
							in 2015, and a typical AVE high-speed train journey in 2020 (post HSR network
							completion). Each map is warped and distorted based on time distance to major
							cities using a specific mode of transportation. [Or rather, each map more
							accurately depicts relative distances based on time-space compression.]
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><em><em><em><em>[[slider id="211"]]</em></em><br></em></em>
						</p>
						<p>For
							example, in the case of Spain, the hub-and-spoke organization of the rail
							network pulls all connected cities closer to the hub, which is Madrid. But
							because there is no direct high-speed connection between, say, Barcelona and
							Bilbao, those cities are not closer to each other in relative space. Madrid is
							the beneficiary of both connections in terms of time-space, and logic would
							also suggest it as the ultimate economic beneficiary as well. Geography, and
							position within the railroad network, grants certain temporal, as well as
							economic and political, advantages.
						</p>
						<p>
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>Through
							these anamorphic representations, the explicit advantage of one position in
							relative space over another highlights an important feature of the contemporary
							landscape: an increasing disparity in the difficulty of overcoming what David
							Harvey has termed the ‘friction of space.’ When construction on the Galicean high-speed
							network is complete, Madrid will be just over two hours from Ourense. Yet
							Porto, in Portugal, which is similar in absolute distance from Madrid, will
							remain five to six hours from Madrid by car, and a shocking twenty-one hours by
							train. From the perspective of Madrid, Porto is trapped in space whereas
							Ourense is unlocked, the friction of space reduced to the cost of a ticket.

						<p>In
							almost all cases, HSR networks reproduce at least some amount of the pre-existing
							conventional-rail network. Tom Zoellner notes the fundamental influence of nineteenth-century
							railroad networks, declaring:
							<em>Under the skin of modernity lies a skeleton
								of railroad tracks.
							</em> Both physically and in terms of persistent cultural
							and political development trends, the conventional railroad “skeleton” of the nineteenth
							century shapes the HSR networks of the twenty-first century in several
							important ways.

						</figure>
						<p>Firstly, it is much more difficult today to implement brand new national or territorial scale
							infrastructure corridors than it was 200 years ago. Public sentiment towards eminent domain or land
							condemnation towards large-scale transportation projects has soured, and more stringent labor
							regulations and the rising cost of materials makes these projects challenging. There are a variety
							of other factors as well, such as: lack of political will or political disagreement towards system
							design or implementation, strong anti-rail lobbyists from competing transportation modes, NIMBYism,
							lengthy processes for environmental reviews, and the lack of availability of capital to name a few.
							Therefore, expanding existing conventional-rail rights-of-way is usually easier and more expedient
							than forging new connections through private lands, especially in developed urban areas. <span

						<p>Secondly,
							pre-existing conventional systems typically have already linked all the

							route will travel along the same, or similar, path as the conventional network.
							(In fact, the existence of an important conventional rail connection was usually
							a historically important factor in the ability of one city to thrive over
							another in the same region.) There are important exceptions to this
							observation, however, such as in Germany and France.

						<p>Finally,

							Mountainous terrain requires more expensive civil engineering designs,

						<p>The
							first country to develop a true high-speed rail network was Japan in 1964. On
							October 1st, nine days before the Olympic Games were scheduled to begin in
							Tokyo, the first Shinkansen trains departed for Osaka and Tokyo to the fanfare
							of hundreds of citizens and visitors. To the awe of the world, these trains
							would arrive at their destinations a mere four hours later. Only the day before
							the same journey would have taken seven hours. In the summer of 2014, my own
							journey along this route took only two hours and fifty-five minutes, with a top
							speed of 300km per hour. Japan has dramatically compressed the relative distance
							of major urban areas.

						<p>As the pioneers of HSR technology, the Japanese still set the bar for the safest, most timely, and
							most efficient train service in the world. Since 1964, an estimated 5.6 billion passenger trips
							have been made on the train without a single fatality. Delays are within one minute on average,
							even during rain and snow. The network has earthquake-sensing technology, which halts the train in
							the early stages of an event. During rush hours, the network is capable of running one train every
							three minutes on each line.
						</p>
						<p>In the last fifty years the Shinkansen has expanded outward from the original Tokyo-Osaka
							connection on the Tokaido corridor. To date there are an additional seven high-speed routes,
							including two “mini-Shinkansen” that branch off the Tohoku corridor in the north. Three additional
							Shinkansen routes are under construction, extending the system to the tips of the Japanese
							archipelago. In 2015 approximately 1,487 miles of track were operational.

						<p>Though
							Japan wasn’t one of the first countries to adopt conventional rail in the nineteenth
							century, the geography and population distribution on the archipelago were, and
							are, ideal for train travel. The islands are nearly 2,000 miles long in total,
							and relatively narrow: Honshu Island, the major landmass, varies from 31 to 143
							miles wide. The mountainous geography further narrows the inhabitable area of
							the islands, gathering most of the population to the coasts. Japanese historian
							Nobutaka Ike describes the region in the late nineteenth century, writing:
							<em>[B]y
								the time the Western impact began to be felt in the middle of the nineteenth
								century, the Japanese economic system was already sufficiently developed to be
								able to sustain as well as profit from a railroad system. By this time, too,
								the potentialities of an increasing passenger traffic were favorable, since
								Japan had a high population density when compared to the countries of
								contemporary Europe. This then forms the background against which the development
								of the railroads should be viewed.

						<p>The
							Japanese welcomed the new technology from Europe, but not without a few caveats,
							as Nobukata describes:
							<em>In 1867, an official of the Tokugawa government
								actually gave permission to...an American diplomatic official to build a line
								between [Tokyo] and Yokohama. But this [permission] was revoked, over the
								protests of the American Minister, by the new Meiji government, which was
								determined that railroads be built by Japanese and not foreigners.
							</em> As such,
							construction of this first line was slow, but within ten years the Japanese
							were constructing and operating their own railroads with little Western
							involvement. Although the idea of the railroad was planted there by
							Westerners, the Japanese alone were the architects, engineers, and operators
							of their own railroad from the very beginning. This knowledge goes a long way
							towards understanding how the Shinkansen has become a national symbol of Japan.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>After
							construction of the first line, the government opened up construction of
							railroads to private development. While this strategy had the effect of
							encouraging development, it also created problems. For example, investors were
							naturally interested in maximizing profits, and the most profitable scenarios
							for railroad construction were in areas of either high population density or
							low construction costs. This left vast territories without the hope for
							railroad service through private development. As in America, privately
							developed routes were discontinuous and long distance freight charges were
							difficult to estimate if the route involved multiple carriers. Although Japan
							had adopted a common narrow gauge design for the tracks, other design elements
							such as platform height and width were not standardized. Early private
							efficiencies on the local scale resulted in regional obstacles to good rail
							travel.

						<p>This

							government controlled 90% of all railroads in Japan. Growth of the network

						<p>The key to this imagined future, physically and in the collective Japanese imagination, was the

							would link Tokyo, the Japanese political, economic, and cultural capital, to all the nations of the
							Co-Prosperity Sphere at the highest speeds imaginable for rail transportation. It would catalyze
							Japanese colonization and resource development throughout the territories, creating a connected

								target="_blank">PWR article</a> above captures the excitement of the age: <em>Imagine, we are on

						<p>It was not the ship, nor the plane, nor the automobile, but the high-speed train that became the
							shared imaginary of modernization in Japan. World War II halted development of the routes, though
							land was purchased and a few tunnels even constructed before Japanese efforts were diverted to the

								ressha</i>. The idea was resurrected before the Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964, this time under the
							moniker of <i>Shinkansen</i> (新幹線), which translates to “new main network” or “new trunk line.”
							This name alludes to the choice of gauge for the new network, which would be designed at the
							international standard gauge instead of the narrow gauge of the local routes. This technical
							decision ensured that the Shinkansen would never integrate with the local routes, operating at a
							scale between the city and the nation without entering into local scale.

						</figure>
						<p>While the post-war Shinkansen plans leverage the imagination of the <em>dangan ressha</em>, the
							scope is more national in focus. Instead of connecting Tokyo to its colonies, the Shinkansen would
							connect Tokyo with the hinterlands of its home islands. According to a recent Guardian article:
							<em>All previous railways were designed to serve regions. The purpose of the Tokaido Shinkansen,
								true to its name, was to bring people to the capital.</em> Takashi Hara, an expert on Japanese
							railroads, has stated: <em>The purpose was to connect regional areas to Tokyo...and that led to the
								current situation of a national Shinkansen network, which completely changed the face of Japan.
								Travel times were shortened and vibration was alleviated, making it possible for more convenient
								business and pleasure trips, but I have to say that the project just made all the [connecting]
								cities part of Tokyo.</em>
						</p>
						<p><em><em>[[slider id="221"]]</em></em>
						</p>
						<p>These
							quotes suggest that the Shinkansen has expanded the boundaries of the city into
							the nation itself, collapsing the scale of the territory and conflating the
							traditional scales of nation and city. This phenomenon is seen in other
							examples throughout the research, but it should be noted that this condition of
							“nation as mega-city” is particularly suited to Japan’s culture, geography, and
							business practices. For example, in the traditional paternal culture Japanese
							corporations often pay for employees’ commuting costs. Since the Shinkansen
							makes the suburbs temporally proximate to Tokyo, and cost of the ticket isn’t a
							primary factor, the extent of the city is expanded. The nation itself is
							relatively small, fitting easily in one time zone. Socially and culturally, the
							notion of homogeneity is perceived as positive. Journalist Allison Hight states:
							<em>There is little emphasis placed on the individual, and people instead derive
								their worth and usefulness from their ability to work as part of a team.
								<o:p></o:p>

						<p>In
							short, the development of Japan’s rail network exhibits the market forces of the

							possible, the phenomena is heavily reinforced by the Japanese geo-cultural
							tendencies. “If you look closely, you will notice that the most dramatic change
							enveloping Tokyo is in the kinds of people found here. This is a natural and
							inevitable result of the extension of modern transportation,” says Tayama Katai
							in
							<i>Thirty Years in Tokyo</i>. The
							Shinkansen changed the face of Tokyo and reorganized space on the island

						<p>Although
							the historical conditions were quite different, the development of the French
							<em>Train
								a Grande Vitesse
							</em> (TGV) high-speed rail network has much in common with the
							Japanese Shinkansen network. Both use a hub-and-spoke diagram to connect
							second-tier cities to a populous and expansive national capital. Both employ
							dedicated high-speed passenger networks, though France does have some amount of
							blended access in urban station approaches and at route branches near the end
							of the lines, and the TGVs are equipped to travel on local routes at slower
							speeds. Both networks achieve a substantial collapse of the scale of the
							territory and conflation of the traditional operative design scales of nation
							and city. Unlike Japan though, France’s development has nearly always been
							centrally planned by the government in some form, and the Shinkansen was an
							important motivator for the French in the creation of their own TGV.

						<p>In
							early-nineteenth-century Europe, railroad development was thriving in
							industrialized and laissez-faire economies such as in the UK, Belgium, and
							Prussia (Germany). But in France, conditions for private development of
							railroads were not favorable. At the time, France was less industrialized than
							her neighbors, and lacked the important natural resources of coal and iron ore
							that propelled the UK’s industrial revolution and railroad construction. Iron
							production was slow also, which further hindered industrial scale track
							construction. France had ample natural waterways too and had invested heavily
							in the construction of canals, and the water transportation industry lobbied
							against the new railroads. The country was still recovering from the Napoleonic
							Wars (1803–1815), which shifted focus to the reconstruction of important
							cities. Additionally, the lack of a strong unified national government caused
							lengthy delays towards developing a national policy for rail development.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>In
							the early years a few lines gained the required capital and approvals for
							operation. Permission was given by royal decree in 1827 for construction of a
							line from Saint-Etienne to Andrezieux for goods, extended to Lyon in 1830 for
							passengers. The first dedicated passenger train was opened in 1837, from Paris
							to St. Germain. It was an enormous success, carrying 18,000 passengers on its
							inaugural day of service. Despite these few lines (totaling only 354 miles) operating
							in the early years, a national effort towards developing a railroad network
							wasn’t really begun until a railroad law was passed in 1842.

							<figcaption>Early railroad development in France. Notice the hub-and-spoke typology developing more
								strongly after the national railroad law was passed in 1842. </figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>This law conditioned the development of the railroad network through the following parameters:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The state would acquire the necessary right-of-way, design the railroad through the Ponts et
								Chaussees (a sort of national engineering department), and prepare the roadbed, bridges and
								tunnels.</li>
							<li>Private developers would supply the tracks, rolling stock, stations, and operate the lines.
							</li>
							<li>Long term leases were granted: 37 years to begin, later extended to 99 years.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>This
							arrangement eased the way for private development of railroads, but the
							national government determined which routes were given consideration. So it
							comes as no surprise that all major routes radiated from Paris, France's
							political, cultural, and economic capital. The small companies that undertook
							initial construction of the lines were eventually bought and consolidated into
							six major rail monopolies: Nord, Est, Ouest, Paris-Orleans,
							Paris-Lyon-Mediterranee, and Midi. These companies built grand terminal stations
							in Paris, but did not connect with each other and no two lines operated out of
							the same station. Their routes into Paris did not merge with each other,
							remaining separate and terminating at what was then the periphery of the city.
							This urban arrangement of stations can be seen in many cities, including
							London, Vienna, and contemporary applications in Beijing and Shanghai. (This
							development pattern is an important reason historic train stations tend to be
							typologically designed as terminal stations, whereas high-speed rail has
							largely invented the contemporary through station.)

						<p>This was not an efficient system. For passengers whose destination was not Paris, a lengthy
							transfer across town by foot or hired carriage was always required. Goods had to be offloaded and
							transported similarly to other stations for further destinations. East-west movement across the
							country was still difficult, requiring an unnecessary trip into Paris. At this time, the
							conventional railroad network did a good job of connecting cities to Paris, but a rather poor job
							of connecting second-tier cities to each other. The network design fragmented the country into
							wedges, each defined and monopolized by private railroad operator.
						</p>
						<p>Although
							successful and integral to the movement of goods and people through the
							country, all the major railroad companies were operating at a deficit in the
							early twentieth century. It was determined that the largest railroad monopolies
							would be nationalized in 1937 into the Societe national des chemins de fer
							francais (SNCF), a public-private entity. World War II brought occupation by
							the Germans and significant destruction of the railroad system, requiring SNCF
							to cut service to secondary lines after WWII in an effort to stem financial
							losses and improve service on the primary network.

						<p>Paris

							century challenged the traditional dominance of Paris and encouraged reflection
							on the role of the French territory. In 1947 geographer and professor
							Jean-Francois Gravier published an important and influential study titled
							“Paris et le desert francais” (“Paris and the French Desert”), which highlighted
							the disparities between rural France and the capital. He cautioned that,
							“Two-thirds of France is slowly dying” and encouraged economists and
							politicians to address the strong imbalances between Paris and the country at
							large. Later, an
							<i>exode rurale</i> between
							1952–1962 of rural to urban migration was a further cause of concern to
							politicians, geographers, and economists alike. Jacob Meunier cites:
							<em>By 1968,
								some twelve million French men and women had migrated from the country to the
								city. France, 46% rural immediately after the war, was only 34% rural by the
								end of 1960s.

						<p>This
							concern led to a large scale program of incentives for industrial, demographic,
							and cultural decentralization along with agricultural modernization overseen by
							a new and powerful government organization, the Delegation interministerielle a
							l'amenagement du territoire et a l'attractivite regionale (DATAR), which still
							exists today under a slightly different acronym. DATAR’s strategy to address
							the powerful hegemony of Paris was to designate eight regional capitals for
							targeted development: Lille/Roubaix Tourcoing, Nancy/Metz/Thionville,
							Strasbourg, Lyon/Saint Etienne/Grenoble, Marseille/Aix-en-Provence/Delta du
							Rhone, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Nantes/Saint Nazaire. Along with plans to
							incentivize demographic, industrial, and economic growth, DATAR advocated for
							transportation development within these metropoles (usually highways) and would
							often find itself naturally at odds with the SNCF, which was cutting service to
							secondary lines in these areas. Furthermore, DATAR supported another high-speed
							rail technology under development by Jean Bertin at the time called the
							Aerotrain.
						</p>
						<p>Within
							this condition of existing tension between the urban (mainly Paris) and the
							rural, and between SNCF and DATAR, the Shinkansen made its inaugural run from
							Tokyo to Osaka in Japan. Like Germany and the United States and, indeed, most
							countries at the time, France was inspired by the Shinkansen in the 1960s and
							unsettled by the oil crisis of the 1970s. SNCF began research into a high-speed
							rail system for France and soon developed the technology for a TGV high-speed train compatible with
							both existing conventional lines
							and a new network of
							<em>Lignes a Grande Vitesse</em> (LGV) high-speed lines. The first
							route from Paris to Lyon, also known as the LGV Sud-Est, was wildly successful
							and led to an expansion of the network to the south (LGV Rhone-Alpes and LGV
							Mediterranee), and new lines in the west (LGV Atlantique), north (LGV Nord),
							and east (LGV Est).

						<p>The
							LGV network doesn’t trace the primary conventional routes exactly, but it does
							establish a similar spoke-and-hub network that recreates the inherent
							difficulties of the conventional system. For example, the LGV Atlantique
							departs from Gare Montparnasse to Le Mans and Tours, the LGV Nord departs from Gare
							du Nord to Lille, and the LGV Est departs from Gare l’Est to Strasbourg. TGVs
							terminate in Paris at the historic conventional stations, so as it was
							throughout history, it’s easy to get to Paris but harder to simply go through
							Paris. The separate lines functionally create “wedges” of TGV service extending
							from Paris into the hinterlands, but do little to connect the regions to each
							other. Despite the creation of DATAR and its advocation for decentralization,
							east-west movement across the country remains difficult and usually requires a
							trip through Paris. Furthermore, investment in the LGV network has come with
							certain costs for the conventional network.

						<p>Michael

							<em>The thirty years of the TGV in public service have been a

								that the development of the TGV network has been at the expense of investment
								in the classic [network].
							</em> Given SNCF’s policy of privileging main network
							service over secondary lines/local interests to maximize profit, the
							development of the network in this way is not surprising. Still, DATAR and
							local interests have had some effect on the quantity and location of TGV
							stations, if not the design of the overall network. One example is the case of
							the first LGV from Paris to Lyon.

						<p>During
							initial route planning in 1973 SNCF created several alternatives. Option one
							largely followed the existing conventional network to Lyon, establishing new
							tracks only to Dijon and utilizing the existing quadruple-tracked route from
							Dijon to Lyon. The second option was similarly routed through Dijon, though not
							parallel the existing route at all times. The third option included new,
							dedicated track to Lyon via Troyes and Dijon. The fourth option suggested new,
							dedicated track in an almost straight line to Dijon, bypassing Troyes and then
							heading south to Lyon. Options five and six called for new high-speed lines
							from Paris to a point on the conventional rail network near Dijon, at which
							point branch service would accommodate Dijon and trains would continue to Lyon.
							Option seven was SNCF’s preferred route (see above), which bypassed Dijon in
							order to create a nearly straight-line solution to Lyon. Branch service off the
							new line at Aisy and Macon would serve mid-size cities in the Burgundy region,
							as well as service to Switzerland and the south of France.

						<p>To the dismay of Dijon and DATAR, SNCF prevailed and the preferred option was constructed. It is
							important to note that intermediate stations at the small cities of Le Creusot and Macon were not
							intended by SNCF. Instead, these cities were incidentally near the straight-line path from Paris to
							Lyon, and city stations were only later included at the urging of DATAR and local governments. In
							order to accommodate these cities, new TGV stations were constructed not at the city centers, but
							at the city periphery such that the route was deviated as little as possible, and station
							construction costs were minimized. The French have a term <i>la gare betterave</i> to describe
							these stations, which translates to “beetfield stations.” This station typology will be discussed
							further in later sections, but their existence provides a good conclusion for this discussion of
							France and the conflation of scales: City//Nation, or rather in this case: Paris//Nation. Although
							SNCF operates some 230 TGV stations, many of them are small, rural <i>gares betteraves</i> with
							limited service. Only large regional cities have new or renovated city-center stations. Coupled
							with the national hub-and-spoke organization, the overall effect of the TGV in France is to bypass
							the region in favor of direct urban to urban connection with Paris.

						<p>Unlike
							France and Japan, the German high-speed rail network is not organized around a
							single primary city. Rather, the organization is polycentric, characterized by
							the dispersed location of several equally important hubs throughout the
							country. As previously mentioned, in most instances high-speed rail networks
							are influenced by the conventional rail development of the nineteenth century.
							In the case of Germany, however, the rail network is also heavily influenced by
							persistent cycles of unification and separation, the political/administrative
							disunity of individual German states (of which there are many), and significant
							fluctuations of the national borders over time. Railroad development by both
							state and private developers began before the German Empire was first unified
							in 1871.

						<p><em>[[time id="223"]]</em>

						<p>The
							first steam railroad was developed between Nuremberg and Fürth in Bavaria in
							1847 by a private company that made the pragmatic decision to adopt the UK’s
							standards for track design for both rail profile (shape of the rail) and gauge
							(width between rails). Development continued throughout the individual German
							states using these standards as a model. Surprisingly, even though the system
							was constructed and operated by individual states and private owners, most of
							the major cities were linked by the 1890s. Unification of the many German
							states in 1871 spurred state level consolidation and cooperation among the
							Lander (individual states) into a comprehensive main network that serviced all
							of the states. Moreover, private railways continued to develop complementary
							services in the form of local and secondary lines. By the First World War, the country
							had established a comprehensive, non-centralized, distributed railway network.

						<p>The German economist Frederick List was the first to lobby for a unified national planning
							initiative in 1887. In his network proposal<del>,</del> the edges of the country are left vague and
							uncertain. The focus instead is on Berlin, the capital, and it’s relationship to the other
							important cities in the nation and especially in the northwest. List’s design shares structural
							elements of the hub and spoke typology established in France. Berlin is positioned as the hub of
							the German Empire, with spokes radiating out to important cities. (Note that in the late nineteenth
							century, Berlin is much more centrally located within the boundary of the country than its current
							location today.) An important variation is the design of the system in the west, with the inclusion
							of circumscribed ring routes connecting cities to each other, as well as to Berlin. This design
							recognizes the importance of interdependence among those cities even in the nineteenth century, and
							is a prescient glance at the future high-speed network in the twenty-first century.

						<p>Germany’s
							defeat in WWI triggered a political upheaval with important ramifications on
							the operation and development of the railway. After the war, the individual
							states would no longer have control of their own lines. Instead, the system was
							further consolidated into one nationalized system in 1924, called the Deutsche
							Reichsbahn (German National Railway). The Reichsbahn was organized as a
							commercial company that would operate to turn a profit, which would largely be
							used to pay war reparations. The company was a complete success, by some
							accounts the most successful in the world at the time, and definitively the
							largest transport company in the world. The backbone of the company was freight
							transportation. Although the Reichsbahn flourished and was able to undertake
							modernization projects, locomotive technology standardization, and the development
							of communication networks along the right-of-way, it eventually felt pressure
							from the growing automobile industry in the early twentieth century.

						<p>On this high note, the Reichsbahn entered the period of WWII and was quickly absorbed into the

								[national] socialists seized power in 1933, the Reichsbahn had already become a tool of the Nazi
								dictatorship. The employees were brought into line by means of systematic dismissals, massive
								propaganda, and ruthless intervention in the corporate structure. The Reichsbahn was now obliged
								to fulfill additional tasks, ranging from job creation schemes to organizing the “Kraft durch
								Freude” (strength through joy) holiday trips and providing basic logistic support for the mass
								rallies of the Nazis. This appropriation reached a climax when the state-owned railway was put
								directly to use in World War II to perpetrate the crimes of the Nazi regime. Neither the war of
								extermination in the East nor the deportation of millions of people to the concentration and
								extermination camps would have been possible without the Reichsbahn.</em>

						<p>At the end of the war, the German Empire was divided into four separate zones controlled
							independently by the allied forces: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet
							Union. By 1949, the French, American and UK divisions in the western part of the country were
							consolidated as the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), or the Bundesrepublik Deutschland
							(BRD). The railways in the BRD were consolidated under the new name of Deutsche Bundesbahn. The
							zone controlled by the Soviet Union was renamed as the German Democratic Republic (East Germany),
							or Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR). The railways in this zone continued to operate under the
							national railways’ previous administrative title of Deutsche Reichsbahn.
						</p>
						<p>The period of separation lasted until German reunification in 1990. During this time, the growth
							and development of the railroad network took two different paths under the governance and economic
							policies of East and West Germany.

							<figcaption>Before WWII, the bulk of railroad transportation flowed east-west across the

								of<br>north-south routes.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>In
							the beginning, substantial work needed to be undertaken in both East and West
							Germany to repair war damage. East Germany was politically isolated and was
							therefore plagued by lack of resources, including elements for the production
							of iron and steel, appropriate materials for structurally sound concrete, and
							ample supplies of coal to produce steam power. The Reichsbahn shifted briefly
							to the production of diesel locomotives until the oil crisis of the 1970s,
							after which it labored to electrify its railway lines. Although the Reichsbahn
							faced developmental hardships, its passenger base was assured due to the lack
							of other available transportation methods in East Germany. Personal automobiles
							were rare; there was a long wait to purchase one, and parts used for repair
							were scarce.
						</p>
						<p>The
							Bundesbahn in West Germany did not face the same shortage of resources as East
							Germany, because of its participation in the global market. Still, the
							Bundesbahn faced steep competition from the car, which at the time was an
							important symbol of freedom and modernity and coveted by the population. In
							addition, for social welfare reasons the ticket prices remained quite low,
							hindering potential profits. Through the late twentieth century, only one new
							line was constructed in West Germany, while most services were offered on the
							existing nineteenth century network upgraded for electrical power supply.
							Because of the high quantity of freight transported from the northern ports,
							and the limited opportunity to connect east/west across the inner border,
							investments were focused on the north/south routes across the state. In 1971,
							the first intercity (IC) services were offered and eventually expanded from
							first class only, to hourly service at all class levels.

						<p>The commencement of the TGV high-speed rail services in France in 1981 spurred a comprehensive plan
							for high-speed rail in West Germany, with the first lines constructed from Hannover to Wurzburg
							before reunification. Even with modernization and expansion of services, West Germany's share of
							intermodal transportation decreased from 1950–1990: 37% to 6% for passenger services, 56% to 21%
							for freight.
						</p>
						<p>For both East and West Germany, the cold war was a time of limited network growth. In Japan (and
							later in France), high-speed rail reinforced the pre-existing hub-and-spoke territorial
							organization and compressed the scale of the nation into the scale of the city. In post-war
							Germany, the greater railroad network was severed from Berlin, its de facto hub. Thus, the network
							reorganized around a more dominant north-south axis and strengthened its polycentric network
							characteristics, compressing the boundaries of individual cities into each other.

							<figcaption>At the end of WWII, there were 47 railroad links that traversed the inner

								eight heavily-guarded rail crossings remained. Even so, crossing the<br>border was an everyday
								occurrence as West German and military trains had<br>right-of-way access to West Berlin.<br>
							</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Although it was difficult for East Germans to leave the country, over time visits from Westerners
							and West Germans to the East were allowed with special visas. The two railroad administrations had
							to productively interact for this to occur, with changes of train crews at each crossing and
							collaboration over timetables. Local transportation in Berlin faced similar challenges due to the
							political separation of the city as well.
						</p>
						<p>Reunification
							in 1990 offered a unique opportunity for the railroad in Germany. Although
							independently the Bundsbahn and Reichsbahn were both struggling financially,
							the newly unified government saw an opportunity for reform as the two states
							merged. As east-west transportation across reunified Germany became possible,
							an influx of freight and passenger demands across Europe were expected.
							Sensitivity to environmental issues was at a peak in the late twentieth
							century, which also added to the potential for success. Railroad reform
							involved changes to the constitution, seven new laws and more than 130 other
							legislative changes. At the end, the two railroads consolidated and Deutsche
							Bahn AG emerged as a joint stock company with an entrepreneurial approach to the
							business of transportation.

							specific development conditions of the politically un-united Lander of the nineteenth
							century, the outcomes of the two World Wars in the early twentieth century, and
							the cold war at the end of the twentieth century. When the newly formed

							within the established trend of convenient inter-city services to a region of closely-knit
							mid-size cities. While investment had been made to north-south routes and
							freight was an important generator of revenue, the east-west connections were
							in poor repair.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p> Unlike
							France, in which most high-speed lines are dedicated and connect Paris with
							second tier cities with few intermediate stops, or Japan with its completely
							dedicated network connecting second tier cities to Tokyo, in Germany the system
							is almost always blended with commuter and freight services, and the schedule
							makes stops at most mid-size cities. Even though portions of the system operate
							at high speeds, the German system is much slower on average than either the
							Japanese or French systems. However, German cities have better connectivity
							with neighboring cities due to the polycentric nature of the network.

						<p>Whereas
							France and Japan, with their respective hub-and-spoke network organizations,
							challenge traditional notions of scale by collapsing the size of the nation to
							the size of the city, the German high-speed rail network establishes more
							profound city-city connections. Although traversing the entire country is still
							rather time consuming, getting from one city to another within the same region
							is quite easy. In addition, the design of the stations focus on inter-modality
							with local bus and streetcar routes making it easy to get to a final
							destination. The high-speed rail network in Germany is more like a very
							comprehensive intra-city subway system that just happens to connect the whole
							country. This network design is in response to, but also reinforces, the
							settlement patterns of the country in which a multitude of mid-size cities
							agglomerate to form substantial conurbations and regional politics demand HSR
							stations in most cities.

						<p>China’s
							railroad network developed in fits and starts at the end of the nineteenth
							century. Like Japan, China was initially wary of the new technology and,
							indeed, of the Westerners promoting it. In 1864 and again in 1876, the Qing
							government dismantled operational railroads constructed by the British and
							Americans, respectively.

							government realized modernization was necessary. Pressure from foreign powers
							resulted in the large-scale construction and operation of railroads by the
							British, American, French, Belgians, Germans, and Russians. The first domestic
							railroad was constructed from Beijing to Zhangjiakou, and by 1911 there were
							almost 5,600 miles of railroads in China. Most of these conventional routes
							established Beijing as a hub, extending out into the rural country to the
							north, south, west, and to the port city of Tianjin to the east.

						<p>Public sentiment never caught up with the need to modernize, however, and displeasure over a
							government ambition to nationalize the routes was a major motivation of the Xinhai Revolution of
							1911, leading to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. At this point, the new administration appointed
							Dr. Sun Yat-sen, a revolutionary and a planner, as the Director of National Railway Planning. Over
							the next few years, Sun Yat-sen developed and promoted an ambitious transportation and economic
							development plan for China (which included Mongolia at the time) that would rely heavily on foreign
							investment for completion. He viewed railways as the key to China's economic development, and
							railroad construction in the United States could provide an appropriate model for China. In a 1912
							speech, Sun noted that the American railway network was 200,000 miles in length. (China's network
							at that time was only 5,600 miles.) Since China was five times as large as the United States, logic
							dictated that they needed a million miles of rail lines.

							started in 1949 with a series of Five Year Plans produced by the Ministry of
							Railways that outlined specific development goals for the network. Lines were

							<figcaption>The increase in miles of passenger and freight rail is tied to an increase in

						</figure>
						<p>Part of the reason for this is China’s ever-growing demand for energy, and in this case the

							power supply. Freight transport capacity is the second bottleneck. Other long-distance freight
							products important to the national economy include raw materials for factory production, such as
							coke, metal ores, iron and steel, petroleum products, grain, fertilizers and other bulk products.
							Freight rail has approximately 60% of market share for inland transportation. In order for China’s
							economy to continue to grow, both of these bottlenecks would need to be relieved.

						<p>To

							existing track, which were upgraded to reach speeds of 100 mph. A final round

						<p>In
							2003, the government issued its Mid- to Long-Range Network Plan (MLRNP) to
							address the persistent shortfalls of the transportation network through to
							2020. Critical to the plan was the goal to create more capacity for both
							freight and passengers through a separation of services by building high-speed
							passenger dedicated lines (PDL) and an upgrade to strategic freight corridors.
							Another important political goal was to connect all provincial capitals with a
							population total over 500,000. The PDL network would consist of four
							north-south routes and four east-west routes totaling 7,500 miles operating at
							speeds up to 218 miles per hour, with an additional 12,500 miles of mixed
							traffic high-speed lines upgraded to 200 km per hour. The MLRNP also specifies
							three key regional conurbations for transportation development: the Yangtze
							River Delta region (Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou); the Pearl River Delta region
							(Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen); and the Bohai Sea Ring (Tianjin, Beijing,
							Qinhuangdao).

						<p>Although
							the network is presented as a grid, it may be useful to view it as a series of
							corridors in response to population and resource distribution. The population
							of China is concentrated in the south and east along the coast, as are the
							important conurbations of Bohai, the Pearl River Delta, and the Yangtze River
							Delta. The north-south lines might be seen as primarily connecting those
							larger, more prosperous population centers as well as the industrial centers of
							the northeast. The east-west routes, then, provide access to rural agricultural
							areas in the west and far west, creating a stronger connection with resource
							rich hinterlands such as the Tibet Autonomous Region.
							<o:p></o:p><br>
						</p>
						<p>The
							combination of speed-up campaigns and the implementation of the MLNRP has
							resulted in the world’s largest national railroad network. Like Spain and
							Germany, a political desire to connect provincial capitals influences the
							network design to some extent. The necessity to balance freight and passenger
							traffic is similar to Germany (although in Germany, freight and passenger lines
							are mixed causing the construction cost per mile of track to be exorbitant.)
							Like France and Japan, China’s solution involves the construction of new
							passenger dedicated high-speed lines.
							<o:p></o:p><br>
						</p>
						<p>Throughout
							China the core railway function is closely monitored by the Ministry of Rail
							(MOR) to manage the integrated and coordinated national railway system that is
							branded as China Rail. The State controls the two key levers of investment
							(through the MOR) and pricing (through the NDRC) and there is little or no
							intra-rail competition in the system. This is perhaps inevitable given the
							acute shortage of capacity that has persisted over the past two decades, but
							such strong control at the top levels of government has its draw-backs for
							customer experience: it is policy to concentrate traffic and operations towards
							maximized throughput, rather than divide the market through competition.
							Therefore, managers operating day-to-day services focus on asset productivity
							rather than customer service. The experience of travel as a passenger on
							Chinese high-speed rail feels more akin to rationing than a free market economy.

						</p>
						<p>-
						</p>
						<p>In
							examination of the national high-speed rail networks of Japan, France, Germany,
							and China, emphasis was placed on the notion that this technology challenges
							the traditional scales of urban planning. In the case of Japan, the Shinkansen
							effectively collapses the scale of the nation down to the scale of the city,
							Tokyo specifically. Few parts of the country are more than an hour or two from
							the capital, expanding practical commuting distance to the point where it can
							be argued that the entire country has become one temporally extended city.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>In
							France, a similar time-space collapse occurs with Paris as the hub. The
							geographic context is different, however, because the overall proportion of the
							country is not linear and the hub is well north of the country's center. It is
							quick and easy to reach the capital from anywhere in the country by hopping on
							a TGV, but connectivity between other urban centers is slower and more
							challenging. In other words, while the benefits of spatial collapse seem to be
							evenly distributed in Japan due to the proportion and relationships of the
							islands, in France there are many parts of the country that do not feel a
							proportional amount of benefit.
						</p>
						<p>Germany’s
							political history and the resulting polycentric high-speed rail network
							exhibits the collapse of boundaries between multiple urban centers into
							interconnected productive regions, rather than reinforcing connectivity to one
							dominant city as in Japan and France. The ICE network is the backbone of
							several scales of efficient German transit, connecting regional airports to
							S-Bahns, local U-Bahns, streetcars, and even bicycles.
							<o:p></o:p>

						<p>Each country exhibits some form of spatial compression, as result of the combined forces of

						<p>As the train began to permeate western culture in the late 1800s and early 1900s, writers, artists,

							and work-intensive eotechnical form of transport, disappears on the railroads.
							The railroad knows only points of departure and destination.” This optimism
							wasn’t shared by all. “They...only serve the points of departure, way stations,
							and terminal, which are mostly at great distances from each other,” writes an
							anonymous French author in 1840, continuing, “they are of no use whatsoever to
							the intervening spaces, which they traverse with disdain, providing them only
							with useless spectacle.”

						<p>Indeed,

							role of the territory with the advent of new train technologies, both in the nineteenth
							century and the twenty-first century. Geographer and professor Eric Sheppard
							likens the changes in positionality wrought by ever increasing speeds to the
							phenomena of a wormhole. “The relationship between positionality and physical
							distance is complex. Positionality often leaps across space and thus cannot be
							read off easily from conventional cartographic images of relative location. I
							find the wormhole to be a useful metaphor for capturing this complexity. When
							two relatively isolated places become closely connected, meaning that their
							positionality becomes closely interrelated, then a worm-hole opens between
							them.“

						<p>A train ride is not a road trip. In a car, territory is encountered and traversed frontally. The

							is in alignment with the direction of a person’s gaze, like walking—one foot in front of the other.
						</p>
						<p>On a train, territory is experienced laterally and peripherally through a window to the right or

						<p>France
							was the second nation to adopt high-speed rail. Given its success in the
							country, it is no surprise that the TGV has become a national symbol of France.
							The TGVs are not as roomy as the Shinkansens or even the Amtrak Superliners,
							but they are still more accommodating than an airline seat. The café cars are
							lively and offer excellent* wine, cheese, and chocolate.
						</p>
						<p>The topography of France, as compared to Japan or Spain, is relatively flat and the LGV routes are
							remarkably straight. Many of the busiest routes employ double-decker trains to accommodate the huge
							demand for travel. The TGV experience, especially from the second level, is of the train cutting a
							quiet, consistent slice through the mostly agricultural landscape, which is visible for miles
							beyond the window. There very few tunnels or viaducts. The sense of speed is communicated mostly
							through a quiet humming of wheels on rail. Conversations on the TGV are mostly muted, perhaps
							because of the lulling effect of the humming wheels.

						<p>The
							Qinghai Railway in Tibet is technically not a high-speed route, yet it is the
							highest elevation route in the world. Both the tracks and the rolling stock are
							specially engineered for the higher elevations and to accommodate the extensive
							areas of ecologically sensitive permafrost along the route. Much of the line is
							constructed as a viaduct with columns extending deep into the earth. Where not
							elevated, the track is built on a tall, ventilated granite embankment that is
							shielded from the sun with shading panels. “Cooling sticks,” long pipes filled
							with ammonia pierce the ground below the embankment. As temperature increases,
							liquid ammonia becomes gas and pulls heat from the ground, cooling the
							substructure. Global warming threatens the entire line, as a consistent
							increase in temperature of just one to two degrees Celsius could destabilize
							the permafrost. The rolling stock is oxygenated, increasing the oxygen level
							from 21% to 24–25% to mitigate the effects of hypoxia.

						<p>In
							Germany, the organization of cities is relatively decentralized. Rather than

							medium-sized cities that form larger urban agglomerations. Still, the distinction
							between urban and rural is quite pronounced, with little of what Americans know

							between it slips passed tight groups of houses and wide agricultural fields. As author Ruth Levy

							<em>“Trains go where cars cannot: into canyons, along rivers, through mountains, sidling up to back

						<p>Clearly,
							high-speed rail has much in common with its steam and diesel ancestors. So the
							question is then, Has HSR made a significant spatial impact beyond the existing
							impacts of the conventional railroad? Yes and no. Some of the spatial
							implications are new, and have to do with the train and its integration with
							contemporary modes of transit (such as airplanes and cars) or contemporary
							urban organizations (suburbs and edge cities). Other implications are simply
							amplifications of conventional impacts. For example, a new train station was
							always a boon for a small town, focusing growth and activity at the station.
							But the intensity of urban development planned around new stations today is
							unprecedented.
						</p>
						<p>Moreover,
							the engineering of the tracks and the routes for high-speed trains is more
							complicated than conventional trains. The high speeds require the routes to be
							as straight as possible, and for any curves to have extremely large radii.
							Elevation changes are undesirable yet achievable with higher energy input.
							Because speed is such an important consideration, and construction costs per
							mile are high, even small reroutes for stops in smaller towns are often highly
							contested. These technical limitations, along with the high cost of constructing
							stations in existing cities, have led to HSR station development in peri-urban
							or non-urban sites.
						</p>
						<p>This section uses specific case studies to document the roles of HSR station development (in
							various locations relative to urban centers) in the organization of a territory. This list of cases
							is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather to highlight a variety of examples.
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.1</h4>
						<h3>Historic Urban Center</h3>
						<p>In some cases, stations within historic urban centers are modified to accommodate high-speed rail
							service. At times the station is almost entirely re-utilized with little modification, at others
							only a small portion of the historic station remains. The advantage of reusing central city
							stations is the location: direct downtown connection. The disadvantages include the technical
							complexity of expanding rail corridors, or developing the station area with other land uses (like
							hotels and office space) that are compatible with HSR stations.
						</p>
						<p>The following case studies highlight several examples of station development in historic urban
							centers.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[typology id="241"]]</em>
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.2</h4>
						<h3>New Urban Center Stations</h3>
						<p>A new urban center station is characterized by substantial city development around an HSR station
							where there was previously minimal development. Often these cases take advantage of decommissioned
							military sites or formerly industrial sites: locations that are near the historic city center, with
							large parcels for HSR friendly development and few stakeholder groups that might be negatively
							affected by development. It is commonly held that HSR stations, in and of themselves, are not
							capable of producing a new urban center. Rather, successful new urban centers are created only when
							new stations are accompanied by reciprocal investment in local transit, economic development,
							housing, hotels, etc.
						</p>
						<p>The following case studies note the development scenario in which HSR was one factor in creating a
							successful new urban center.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[typology id="242"]]</em>
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.3</h4>
						<h3>Urban Periphery Stations</h3>
						<p>Given the complexity of locating HSR stations in dense urban environments, sites on the edges of
							existing cities are sometimes selected for station development. When these sites are designed with
							a good urban framework, an appropriate mix of land uses, thoughtful consideration of site
							opportunities and limitations, and good public transit, these types of sites have the potential to
							develop into viable neighborhoods or new centers.
						</p>
						<p>The following case studies highlight HSR stations that have been sited at the periphery of a city
							(with varied results).
						</p>
						<p><em>[[typology id="243"]]</em>
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.4</h4>
						<h3>Suburban Stations</h3>
						<p>Usually,
							when we think of a journey by train (high-speed or conventional), we think of
							zipping through the countryside passed farms and crops and tiny houses dotting
							the landscape, arriving at our destination firmly inside a city center. We
							don't imagine stopping in the country, let alone in a suburban environment. But
							contemporary HSR stations have been developed to address a wider range of
							scenarios than just the city, inventing new station typologies to accommodate
							contemporary urbanization patterns.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>The following case studies highlight HSR stations in suburban environments.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[typology id="244"]]</em>
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.5</h4>
						<h3>Rural Stations</h3>
						<p>A
							unique term for rural stations was coined by the French:
							<i>la gare betterave</i>, which translates directly to “beetfield station.”
							In other words stations located in the middle of nowhere. There are many
							reasons that HSR stations would be located in a rural setting: less overall
							route deviation means faster connections between major cities; upgrading or
							expanding rail corridors in existing cities is often complex and costly; and land
							acquisition for complementary development around a new station is more
							difficult inside a city. Given the auto-dependent nature of the built
							environment in America, access to more rural locations could require stations
							similar to those presented here.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>The following case studies document HSR stations in rural locations.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[typology id="245"]]</em>
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.6</h4>
						<h3>Suburban//Urban Networked Stations</h3>
						<p>When developing an HSR network, one of the first major considerations is the station location.
							Centrally located urban stations offer convenience, while peripheral or suburban stations offer
							lower construction costs and fewer development difficulties. In most European and Asian examples,
							central city locations offer the most access to the greatest number of potential travelers. But in
							the US, where a greater number live in suburbs, that may not always be the case. Traditional
							development patterns suggest that successful rail development should address both conditions, urban
							and suburban, in the design of an HSR network.
						</p>
						<p>In the following case studies, a central city station and a suburban or periphery station work in
							tandem to provide access to both urban and suburban populations.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[typology id="246"]]</em>
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>2.4.7</h4>
						<h3>Airport Stations</h3>
						<p>High-speed rail is often advertised as an alternative to air travel. However, in both European and
							Asian precedents, stations have been incorporated into (or near) new and existing airports. In
							these cases, HSR has been used to establish intermodal hubs, to complement international or long
							haul flights, and to increase airport access throughout a given region. Most HSR airport stations
							present themselves simply as stops along a given route, while in other cases direct HSR links have
							been specifically developed to connect a major city to an airport.

						<p>There
							are two broad categories, or typologies, of urban train stations: terminal
							stations and through stations. A
							<strong>terminal station</strong> is a structure that is
							positioned at the final destination of a railroad and is more typical of historic
							train stations. The structure is often a grand, cathedral-like building with vaulted
							ceilings and train platforms right at street level. You can step off the train,
							slip through a bustling station, across a plaza, and right into the heart of
							the city.

						</figure>
						<p>Over
							time, as private railroads were nationalized and train technology shifted from
							steam to electric, the through station became the more typical station
							typology. A
							<strong>through station</strong>, quite simply, is a station that is not the final
							destination for the route. The tracks extend through and beyond rather than
							terminating at the station. The passenger’s path from station platform to city
							usually involves some amount of vertical transition, requiring tunnels or
							bridges perpendicular to the direction of the trains. A through station is more
							typical of contemporary HSR stations.

						<p>Terminal
							stations and through stations produce distinctly different urban situations and
							passenger experiences. With a terminal station, trains must enter the station
							and then back out if they are to continue along a route. This takes extra time
							for the train, though the advantage to the passenger is a continuous, same-level
							flow from train to street with no escalators or elevators to navigate (with
							cumbersome luggage and parcels). With a through station, arrival is at a
							platform island in the middle of a sea of tracks, connected to the station by a
							narrow tunnel or bridge. The procession from train to street is less grand,
							often a confusing experience led by way-finding maps instead of architectural
							cues.

						</figure>
						<p>This
							tendency towards through station construction, even in the most important
							cities, represents a global shift in thinking about the role of cities from
							destination to network. In the nineteenth century, major cities were the financial
							and cultural hubs of the region and thus, usually the final destination for
							passengers. In contrast, HSR stations are usually through stations—even major
							cities are simply a stop on the way to somewhere else.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>Other stations typologies include a crossing station, which is a station situated at the
							intersection of at least two main routes, or a hybrid station, which acts as a terminal station for
							one route, and a through station for another route.

						<h3>Networked Urban Stations</h3>
						<p><strong>MULTIPLE TERMINAL STATIONS<br></strong>Historically,
							it was not unusual for a large city to host several terminal stations. In most
							countries, railroad development in the 1800s was a private endeavor, not a
							public one. Each company would construct a railroad with a large, luxurious
							terminal station at each end in order to attract the most passengers. There was
							no incentive for these companies to share stations, no matter how close their
							route termination points in the city. (Although many of these terminal stations
							appear centrally located today, during construction in the 1800s these stations
							were actually located on the periphery of the growing metropolis.)

						<p>Four
							major stations in Paris act as high-speed rail terminal stations. (There are
							also three important TGV stations located in the Paris suburbs.) Each has been
							renovated and expanded to accommodate high-speed trains, and also incorporate
							metro and commuter rail service. In most cases, long distance travel in France
							requires an urban transfer in Paris. For example, a trip from Strasbourg
							(extreme east of the country) to Marseilles (extreme south of the country)
							would require a trip into Paris with arrival at Gare L’Est, then a local metro
							transfer to Gare de Lyon, where a train can be boarded for Marseilles. In this
							way, the multiple terminal station organization favors Paris over other
							important French cities.

						<p>Great
							Britain has just one high-speed route, HS1, which connects London to the
							European continent via the Channel Tunnel. St. Pancras, a historic terminal
							station, was renovated to receive high-speed trains as the final destination
							for the route in London. (The other major terminal stations in the city are
							destinations for commuter and long distance trains with destinations throughout
							England and Scotland.) The next proposed high-speed route, HS2, would depart
							from Euston station with a destination in Manchester to the north. Like Paris,
							regional rail terminal stations are only connected to one another via local
							subway or light rail.

						<p>China
							is unusual in that most of its HSR stations are designed as through stations,
							but function as terminal stations. Beijing, for instance, has four stations for
							passenger trains, three of which offer high-speed options: Beijing West
							Station, Beijing South Station, and Beijing Central Station. From Shanghai, high-speed
							trains will only arrive at Beijing South (not west, east, or north stations)
							and will not continue on to other stations. (The map above uses Open Street Map
							data, which is incomplete for Beijing.)
						</p>
						<p><strong>MULTIPLE THROUGH STATIONS<br></strong>Several
							examples have adopted a strategy of high-speed rail integration that utilizes
							multiple through stations within the city center. A through station always
							privileges the larger network over the individual city: trains may continue on
							a route easily, instead of backing out, as is the case with a terminal station.
							A city with multiple through stations allows for maximum ease for the passenger
							arriving and departing, especially in cities with dispersed locations of
							relative importance.

						<p>Berlin

						<p>The
							four other primary stations in Berlin are located at the city’s periphery in
							somewhat less urban scenarios. Of particular interest is Berlin Sudkreuze
							(southern cross), a suburban station situated at the intersection of the
							southern HSR route to Munich, and the Ringbahn, which is a local transit line
							that encircles the city. The character of Sudkreuze is very different than the
							Hauptbahnhof. While the station has a few shops, food kiosks, and a public
							plaza, it is much more modest in scale (in response to its suburban location).
							Much of the station is dedicated to parking; the station is well connected to
							transit, but naturally many of the passengers arrive by car to this station.
							Similar to Gare Aix-en-Provence TGV, the station is largely situated above the
							tracks themselves. But here the parking is accommodated within the station,
							rather than around the station in surface lots. This leaves the adjacent
							parcels unencumbered for future development, and the overall footprint of the
							station is more compact and friendly to its neighboring parcels.
						</p>
						<p>Berlin
							Sudkreuze is a more convenient station for those who live in the southern
							portion of the city, and those who arrive to the station by car. Moreover, it
							is a more convenient departure point for those travelling from the south whose
							final destination is in the east and west portion of the city, because of the
							convenient connection to the Ringbahn. Rather than travelling into the city
							center and then back out to the periphery, the Ringbahn acts as a sort of
							shortcut to the final destination in these places.

						<p>Tokyo also has three primary stations that service the high-speed Shinkansen trains: Shingawa
							Station, Tokyo Station, and Ueno Station. However, these three stations do not work as an
							interconnected network in the same way as the multiple primary stations in Brussels or Berlin.
							Instead, Tokyo station acts as a terminal station and the final destination for all Shinkansen
							routes to the north, west, and south of the country. Shingawa is an urban station in Tokyo that
							services all Shinkansen trains travelling on the Tokaido route from Tokyo Station. (This station is
							also the planned terminus for the new Osaka-Tokyo Maglev train.) Similarly, Ueno is an urban
							station in Tokyo that services all Shinkansen trains on the Joetsu, Nagano, Tohoku, Yamagata, and
							Akita routes from Tokyo Station. Narita Express (NEX) trains also service Tokyo Station and
							Shingawa Station.
						</p>
						<p>Although
							Tokyo has a comprehensive and efficient metro network, it is often more
							convenient for passengers to depart the train within the city, but before the
							final destination at Tokyo Station. Shingawa and Ueno Stations allow passengers
							to disperse into the metro system more efficiently than relying on a single
							central station, which is important because the Shinkansen network is so
							heavily used.

						<p>Other examples of multiple through stations within a city include Dresden, Cologne, and Hamburg
							among others.
						</p>
						<p><strong>HISTORIC TERMINAL STATION + CONTEMPORARY THROUGH STATION<br></strong>Another
							variation for cities with multiple stations is a combination of a historic
							terminal station with the development of a new, contemporary through station.
							In some cases, only the through station accommodates high-speed rail, while the
							historic station acts as a hub for commuter services and local metro access. In
							others, the historic station accommodates some high-speed rail as well as
							conventional services. The decision to develop a new station in addition to a historic
							station is often made to facilitate the opportunity to develop complementary
							land uses in areas outside of the historic core.

						<p>Such

							station in the center city, it was determined that a former military site near
							the existing station would provide a better location for developing a
							contemporary through station and complimentary programs, as well as resolve a
							number of infrastructure challenges. The site could be described as peripheral,

						<p>Many
							research organizations declare HSR does not create economic development in and
							of itself. Although a new HSR station can become a catalyst, it must be
							accompanied by other methods of development in order to create a robust urban
							amenity. Such is the case with Lille: not only was a TGV station constructed,
							but a variety of complimentary uses were developed in one cohesive planning
							effort. The city was formerly an industrial center, and yet the local
							government made targeted investments to develop the city’s service sector,
							which is better suited to make use of a high-speed rail station.

						<p>The

							apartments, a theater and a new park, a major shopping mall, and the Espace le
							Corbusier, a new park. Gare de Lille-Flandres remains as a primary station for
							regional trains, and transfer to the international TGV station can be made in
							about ten minutes. The close location of the former military site to the

						<p>The
							scenario in Turin also involves a concerted shift from industrial activities
							toward knowledge, tech, and service economies. The city has historically been
							an important manufacturing center for the Piedmont region in northern Italy.
							Unused factories on large parcels of land dotted the city center, and the
							at-grade train tracks divided the city into halves. Instead of expanding the
							city to accommodate the new service industry, the city launched a planning
							effort to rebuild within the city on the old industrial properties. A series of
							large-scale development projects ensued under the vision of “La Spina,” a new
							spine for the city. International events such as the Winter Olympics of 2006
							provided incentive for some of the projects.

						<h4>2.5.3</h4>
						<h3>New Sectional Experiences</h3>
						<p>As discussed in Part 1, the shift from steam to electric power in the early twentieth century
							challenged the necessity of the most iconic architectural feature of the stations: the train shed.
							Locomotives were no longer puffing copious amounts of steam and smoke into the air, and so the
							large volume of space above the platforms was no longer necessary. Trains could now be routed below
							grade, giving over the ground level for other types of spaces.
						</p>
						<p>In
							part because of the switch from steam to electric, and in part because of the
							emergence of the megalopolis and conurbation, HSR stations tend to be designed
							as through stations, while historic stations for conventional rail were more
							often terminal stations. By necessity, through stations involve some amount of
							vertical circulation in order to allow for movement over or under the tracks.
							As the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention, and many contemporary
							HSR stations employ inventive circulation strategies creating new sectional
							experiences for the passenger. Historic stations that have been renovated to
							accommodate HSR, metros, and other forms of transit often employ interesting
							sectional strategies as well.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><strong>BRIDGE STATIONS<br></strong>Wide
							corridors of railway tracks tend to divide a city and create disparate
							conditions on either side: a condition described with accuracy by the common
							expression “the wrong side of the tracks.” The development of HSR through a
							city can be an opportunity to address these disparities with a station designed
							as a bridge.
							<o:p></o:p>

						<p><em>[[slider id="2531"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p>The
							existing Tiburtina station—located at the periphery of historic central Rome—was
							demolished to make way for the new station in 2007. Although smaller than Roma
							Termini, the historic terminal station in the city center, the intent is for
							Tiburtina to accommodate a majority of the high-speed trains in and out of
							Rome. The 800 foot-long, 165 foot-wide station floats nearly 30 feet above 29
							platforms, providing a physical connection between two districts historically
							separated by the railway line—the Nomentano district and the Pietralata urban
							park. The “landing points” at both sides of the station feature urban plazas,
							transfers to both local and long-distance buses, taxis, and access to the local
							metro.

						<p>The
							station is conceived as an “urban gallery,” a double height glass bar building
							programmed with the usual mix of restaurants, shops, and station functions such
							as ticketing and waiting areas. The procession from street to the main
							concourse is quite grand: a large glass volume contains multilevel escalators
							up to the bridge level. Suspended sculptural volumes hover above the bridge
							concourse, providing space for first class passenger lobbies and other
							functions.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><strong>TUNNELED TRACKS<br></strong>Turin’s Porta Susa is similar to Tiburtina in it’s goal of
							reconnecting neighborhoods historically divided by a rail corridor. In this case, a major urban
							project called for burying the rail corridor and creating a grand urban avenue above.

						<p>The
							station structure is 1,250 feet long, 100 feet wide, and varies from 42 to 62
							feet in height. It lies parallel to the tracks, and the platforms are accessed
							via several bridges that lie just below the avenue level. A bus transfer area
							is located to the east of the station, below which a multilevel underground
							parking garage is being developed. The metro is accessible on the lowest level.
							Surrounding development includes a hotel tower at the south of the site.

						<p><strong>HISTORIC STATION ADDITIONS<br></strong>Strasbourg TGV station in eastern France began as a
							historic through station built by Germany during a period of occupation in the late 1800s. To
							accommodate the LGV Est, the station would need to to be replaced, or renovated, modernized, and
							expanded accordingly. Rather than demolish the station, a large glazed canopy was added to the
							front facade to create interior space for a modern concourse.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[slider id="2533"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p>Although
							the canopy is the most striking feature of the renovation, even more
							interesting are the additions on several below-grade levels under the canopy
							and entrance plaza. On the lowest level, access is provided to local trams,
							buses, and the metro. Above are shops, cafés, and an expansive bicycle rental
							facility (Strasbourg is the cycling capital of France!). A large underground
							parking garage is located just below the plaza. The levels are connected with
							an atrium open to the glazed canopy above. The multilevel addition, most of
							which is below ground, provides space for the additional facilities and
							amenities required of a modern HSR station.
						</p>
						<p>Antwerp Central Station, often cited as one of the most impressive historic train stations in the
							world, is another example of a grand terminal station renovated to accommodate high-speed rail
							through an interesting sectional strategy. Constructed in phases at the turn of the century, the
							city grew around the massive station such that today it feels quite centrally located. Like most
							historic stations, Antwerp Central was designed to be a terminal station. In this case, trains
							arrived at the station on a raised viaduct through the city instead of at grade, and the terminal
							platforms were on level 2 of the station.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[slider id="2534"]]</em>
						</p>
						<p>A
							major restoration and renovation in the 1990s and early 2000s added two levels
							below the original station to accommodate a lower level of terminal platforms,
							and a set of tunneled through platforms for HSR routes extending north to
							Amsterdam. The lower levels feel more contemporary, creating a striking
							contrast with the cathedral-like main levels from which light spills into the
							lower levels. A second, contemporary entrance atrium was added on the southeast
							end of the platforms, which increases neighborhood accessibility. The station
							is often used for cultural events, such as concerts, dances, and even a party
							to celebrate the birth of a new baby elephant at the nearby Antwerp Zoo.

						</p>
						<p><strong>OPEN STATION (LILLE)<br></strong>The
							challenge for Lille’s new TGV station was the complexity of existing
							infrastructure at the site, a former military barracks positioned between the
							historic central city and the nearest suburbs. A ring road bisected the site,
							and the program called for new TGV lines, a metro stop, and parking garages.
							The inventiveness of the site plan was discussed in previous subsections, yet
							it is the sectional organization of the station that is of note here.

						<p>The
							station functions are programmed into a plinth structure, with commercial
							towers above that act as landmarks for the city. The TGV tracks are at grade,
							and high-speed trains are visible through the glazed facade facing the historic
							city center. A bridge bifurcates the station towers and connects the suburbs at
							a higher level, to the city center at a lower level.

						<p><strong>SECURITY IN SECTION (CHINESE STATIONS)<br></strong>Chinese
							HSR station design is heavily influenced by rigorous national security
							protocols, which involve a sectional separation of passenger arrival and
							departure flows. The circulation process is as follows:
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><em>[[slider id="2536"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<ul>
						</ul>
						<p>Some Chinese stations are round, others are rectangular or even square in plan. Despite the
							differences in shape, the security protocols are the same at every station in China and the
							sectional experience is similar as well. Given the vast public plazas and highways which usually
							surround the structures, the mono-functional nature of the stations, and the crowds of passengers
							thronging the security queues, Chinese HSR stations often feel simultaneously crowded and isolated.
							Service feels rationed, not purchased.

						<h3 style="font-size: 20px;">Blurry Scales: The Reinvention of the Station Square</h3>
						<p>Train
							stations have always been hubs of activity in city centers, even for people who
							aren't travelling. But as high-speed rail stations have grown in size and
							programmatic variety, the scale of these structures has begun to blur the
							distinction between station and city.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><strong>KYOTO STATION<br></strong>Kyoto Station was completed in 1997 and designed by Hiroshi Hara
							with Atelier 5. Covering nearly 10 acres in the center of Kyoto, the structure itself is enormous;
							the height varies with a maximum of 210 feet, and the longest side of the building is over a 1/4
							mile. Given over 2.5 million square feet of space, facilities for the Shinkansen account for less
							than 10% of the building area.
						</p>
						<p>[[slider id="2541"]]<br>
						</p>
						<p>Any multi-block structure of this size naturally has implications on the urban fabric. But the
							design of Kyoto Station also brings the city into the station in several interesting ways. There is
							a modest plaza at the building’s main entrance known as Ekimae Square. But there are also several
							locations within the station that function as urban gathering spaces, and even have urban titles
							such as East Square, Karasuma Square, South Square, South Promenade, and Muromachi Square. Some of
							these spaces are covered, under the Central Hall's atrium roof, while others are exposed to the sun
							and rain. The circulation between the squares is public, open and continuous. The main atrium space
							is terraced and visual connection to the city beyond is framed and curated throughout the space.
							Traversing through the station squares, gradually shifting from sheltered to unsheltered space in a
							seamless loop, is an experience that challenges the typical distinction of inside/outside, and of
							city/station. To that end, Hiroshi Hara describes the station as a “geographical concourse.”
						</p>
						<p><strong>GUANGZHOU SOUTH STATION<br></strong>A
							similar situation exists in a few rare locations in China. As a rule, train
							stations in China are not open to the public: entry requires an ID and ticket
							check by security guards. Although the stations attract a large quantity of
							users, the national security protocol barring public access means the stations
							never really become an amenity to the surrounding neighborhood. However, in a
							few of the more recently constructed stations, a portion of the building has
							been made accessible to the general public. This is the case for Guangzhou
							South station.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p>[[slider id="2542"]]
						</p>
						<p>The high-speed trains approach the station on a viaduct at the mezzanine level, and so the ground
							level is free for public access. In this design, the structure itself is lifted to allow free
							circulation below the station. Amenities like shops and restaurants are now open to the public, and
							the shade of the concourse paired with the cooling effect of the concrete is welcome in the harsh
							summer. The space under the station is an extension of the urban plaza at the front and rear of the
							station, and in this way the urban and architectural boundaries become blurred.
						</p>
						<p><strong>OMIYA STATION<br></strong>To the extent that the city is pulled into and through the
							station in Kyoto and Guangzhou, the reverse is true in Omiya: here the station is stretched through
							the city along a network of raised sidewalks.

						<p>The station itself is rather underwhelming: large and bunker-like with ribbon windows along the
							length of the structure. The main pedestrian egress is at a mezzanine level platform; taxi and car
							pick-ups circulate below the platform at ground level. The station is situated between several
							large towers and department stores, and the pedestrian platform acts as a direct architectural
							connection into these shopping centers and the wider urban context. Raised walkways within the city
							are not uncommon in Japan, though the network emanating from the station in Omiya is quite
							extensive: pedestrians can travel more than a 1/4 mile into the city from the station along this
							route, as far as the city hall complex in the city center.
						</p>
						<p><strong>NAGASAKI STATION<br></strong>In
							Nagasaki, the small but unique Shinkansen station is designed as a covered
							public square. A radio station is housed on the second level of the adjacent
							building facing the square, and passers-by are sometimes treated to a glimpse
							of a famous musician or live performance through the station windows. The radio
							also provides in-house music for the station. The covered plaza hosts public
							art sculptures, city events, and seasonal items like a large Christmas tree. A
							few shops and the JR ticket station are housed in the adjacent buildings, but
							the main feature of the station is the public space.

						<p><strong>HANNOVER HAUPTBAHNHOF<br></strong>In Omiya, the station was extended into the city via a

						<p>[[slider id="2545"]]<br>
						</p>
						<p>Overlooking reconstruction from damage incurred in World War II, the train station itself is
							fundamentally the same as when it was constructed in 1879. The major program components, including
							a covered platform hall, waiting areas, information desks, and ticket counters remain the same. The
							building materials are largely similar, though perhaps more glass has been used in recent
							renovations. Between 2004 and 2006<del>,</del> the basement level of the station was expanded and
							connected with Niki de Saint Phalle Promenade, a subgrade shopping promenade open to the sky that
							extends from the Hauptbahnhof into the heart of the city. The promenade was preexisting and the
							renovation simply connected the station and opened up the space to the sky above, and yet the
							nature of the space blurs the boundary between the station, as a discrete architectural moment, and
							the city. A 360 degree view is available <a href="http://www.360cities.net/image/promenade-01"

						<p>The train station has always been a place of architectural invention. The train station of the

							existed, such as spaces for passenger waiting, purchasing a ticket, or climbing aboard a train. At
							the same time, advances in construction materials and techniques allowed greater structural spans

						<p>Nearly

							experimentation. The evolution of train technology, advances in tunneling and
							civil engineering, a contemporary interest in “mixed-use” places, and a shift
							in the predominant architectural typology (from terminal station to through station)
							all play a role in the contemporary design of high-speed rail stations. The

						<h3>From Waiting to Shopping</h3>
						<figure data-type="quote" class="wy-figure-small wy-figure-right">
							<blockquote>Over time, traditional waiting rooms have largely disappeared in favor of spaces for
								shopping.<br>

							</blockquote>
						</figure>
						<p>Until the train became commercially available to passengers, there was no architectural precedent
							for large spaces dedicated solely to “waiting.” Train stations required dedicated spaces for
							passengers who arrived early, and for those whose train was delayed. In Europe stations often had
							several waiting rooms based on ticket class: first and second class passengers had access to finely
							appointed rooms with upholstered chairs and carpets, while third class passengers may only have had
							rooms with hard wooden benches. With the advent of high-speed rail, traditional waiting rooms have
							largely disappeared in favor of spaces for shopping. <br>
						</p>
						<p><strong>GARE SAINT-LAZARE<br></strong>In
							some historic stations, this has happened in the form of major renovation.
							While not a station for high-speed rail, Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris is an
							important hub for regional, commuter, and airport trains to both Charles de
							Gaulle and Orly airports. When large scale renovation was needed for the
							station, SNCF partnered with private companies Klépierre and Spie Batignolles
							Immobilier to renovate the station and convert more than 100,000 square feet
							into 80 retail spaces.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><em>[[slider id="2611"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p>The result is a space that feels more like a shopping mall that happens to have a train station
							attached to it. Jean-Marie Duthilleul, lead architect at SNCF, describes the new design: <em>[W]e
								h
							</em><em>ave moved from a one-dimensional tube space where it was impossible to see
								anyone, but just ahead of yourself, to a 3D space where you can see people
								below, above, and around you—like a crowd in the foyer of an opera. Despite the
								fact that there are 500,000 visitors transiting Saint-Lazare every day, that it
								is a very very busy asset, it now offers these people the opportunity to see
								each other, to meet and…maybe even to love each other! Yes, I mean that!
								Because it’s important to find spaces for to meet in real life in this world
								that we call “virtual,” but that in actual fact isn’t virtual at all.”
							</em> Witness
							the man waiting with flowers at a café table, or the young couple kissing on a
							bench.
						</p>
						<p><strong>LEIPZIG HAUPTBAHNHOF<br></strong>The
							Hauptbahnhof in Leipzig was renovated with a similar strategy—a transformation
							of the main waiting space into a multilevel shopping mall. Here, though, the
							ground below the historic terminal station was excavated in order to add two
							levels of shopping connected by a shared atrium.

						<p><strong>VIENNA HAUPTBAHNHOF<br></strong>Germany
							and Austria are at the forefront of urban development focused around major new
							HSR stations. The Hauptbahnhof in Vienna opened in 2014 as a replacement for
							the existing Südbahnhof terminal station. As well as becoming the new hub for
							international high-speed rail in Austria, the station is home to a 215,000
							square foot shopping center “Bahnhof City” with 115 shops and restaurants
							branded on two main levels. Trains arrive at the station on a viaduct at the
							third level, and connections to pedestrian underpasses and the local metro are
							on levels below ground. The shopping center is managed by ECE, a major European
							retail management company with centers in fourteen countries. The station
							itself is just a small part of a 270 acre master plan, establishing a new
							district in the city with several new office towers, 5,000 living units for
							13,000 people, new schools and training centers, and more than seventeen acres
							of new green space.

						<p><strong>SPAIN'S NEW AVE STATIONS<br></strong>Spain
							is also incorporating shopping into the development of AVE high-speed rail
							stations. New stations at Albacete (Los Llanos), Bilbao (Abando Indalecio
							Prieto), Málaga (María Zambrano), Pontevedra (Vigo Guixar), and Salamanca (Salamanca)
							have been developed with shopping malls, grocery stores, hotels, gyms, and
							cinemas managed by Vialia. These larger, more comprehensive stations have been
							cited as real amenities for the cities.

						<h4>2.6.2</h4>
						<h3>The Last Mile</h3>
						<p>The “last mile” is a transportation planning concept that describes the difficulty in getting
							travelers from a transportation node to their final destination. The last mile is a consideration
							in all countries, yet the issue is more acute in America because land use patterns are more
							diffuse, suburbs are the norm, and public transit is often lacking or non-existent.
						</p>
						<p>In nearly every country studied inter-modality was a strong focus of the design (or renovation) of
							a station. A variety of transit modes are routinely integrated into high-speed rail hubs:
							airplanes, regional and commuter trains, subways, buses, streetcars, trams, cars (parking, car
							share and car rental), taxis, and even bicycles. More importantly than transit mode options,
							however, is the efficacy of those options and the ease of accessibility. For example, bike sharing
							might be available at a station, but without a comprehensive cycling network in the city, concerns
							over safety will make cycling unappealing for most people. Train stations, and their transit mode
							options, must be designed with larger transport networks in mind.
						</p>
						<p><strong>CYCLING<br></strong>ICE stations in both Freiburg and Munster embrace the local affinity
							for cycling with ample "radstations," or bicycle parking at the station.

							directly to the popular streetcar stops just below the station: transfer between modes might take
							as few as 30 seconds if the timing is right.

						<p><strong>THE SHARING ECONOMY</strong><strong> AND DRIVERLESS CARS<br></strong>The sharing economy
							and driverless car technology are exciting developments that could offer meaningful solutions for

							sharing solutions, like short-term cycle and car rentals, to extend the reach of passengers beyond
							the station.

						<p>As we turn our attention from the present to the future, it is worthwhile to reflect on the
							research presented in Part 2, and in turn establish an approach for speculations on high-speed rail
							in the American context in Part 3.
						</p>
						<p>With over fifty years of operation, there are many international models that the US can use to
							guide its own adoption of HSR technology. The case studies in Part 2 range from large scale to
							small scale, through various urban/non-urban contexts and geographical/topographical conditions,
							and a variety of historical development scenarios. But it’s not as simple as selecting a TGV or a
							Shinkansen and expecting the same ridership, enthusiasm, or relative levels of success as France or
							Japan. <strong>That’s because transportation is not just technology—transportation is
								culture</strong>. It is influenced by tangible forces, like geography, topography, settlement
							patterns and population density, as well as intangible forces. The cultural character of rail
							travel includes tendencies towards the production, use, and ownership of the built environment,
							existing and emerging technologies and communication methods, attitudes towards collectivism or
							individualism, as well as private and public organizations.
						</p>
						<p>For a high-speed rail system to be effective in the American context, the network and operations
							should consider both the tangible and intangible forces at work in a given location while
							foreseeing future shifts in patterns of living, working, learning, and playing. To complicate the
							equation further, because the US is so vast and differentiated (geographically and culturally) this
							approach must be tailored to each region of HSR implementation. What works in New England might not
							work in Texas or California.
						</p>
						<p>Still, there are important take-aways from my observations that can be applied to a variety of
							locations in the US.
						</p>
						<p><strong>HSR FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT CARS</strong><br><strong></strong>In nearly all cases studied
							high-speed rail is the backbone of a much larger transit network, including commuter or regional
							rail, local metros, bicycle and pedestrian networks, light rail and streetcars, buses, and even
							regional airports. With HSR it is possible to travel great distances quickly and conveniently, all
							without a car. In fact, most HSR stations prioritize pedestrian, cycling, and transit connectivity
							over parking garages. In the US we should use the development of HSR to consider mass transit
							comprehensively, in large and small cities. Where transit already exists, it should be enhanced and
							expanded. Where it does not, HSR presents an opportunity to envision it.
						</p>
						<p><strong>HSR FOR PEOPLE WITH CARS</strong><br>Due to cultural and historical development patterns,
							medium to large cities in Europe and Asia tend to be denser and more walkable than those in the US.
							As the backbone of a larger transit vision, HSR can encourage the adoption of this type of urban
							development. Although much of the population growth in the US is forecasted to occur in urban
							centers, there are still large portions of the population that prefer living outside the city, in
							suburbs or peri-urban neighborhoods where car ownership is still a necessity. HSR trips should be
							easy and convenient for these residents. It will rarely make sense for suburbanites to fight
							traffic into a city station, park at a garage, only to board a train back out of the city. The
							psychological hurdle alone will keep many suburbanites from trying HSR as a replacement for air or
							car travel.
						</p>
						<p>Although suburban HSR stations are rarer than city center stations, they do exist. In order to
							attract ridership from suburban residents, HSR networks in the US will need to incorporate “station
							pairs” in large cities: a complimentary peri-urban station along with a city-center station. The
							city center station privileges pedestrian, cyclist, and mass transit connectivity and surrounding
							land use densifies the city with commercial towers, hotels, apartments, convention centers, etc.
							The peri-urban station hosts more structured parking, potentially with dedicated interstate exits
							and easy circulation to surrounding suburbs. The station may also be connected to regional rail
							networks for added convenience. Additional station stops add time to overall trip durations, but
							high-speed trains already operate at slower speeds on the approach into the city. An additional
							stop at a peri-urban station will not add a great amount of time to an overall trip, but is of
							critical importance to attracting ridershipAs we turn our attention from the present to the future,
							it is worthwhile to reflect on the research presented in Part 2, and in turn establish an approach
							for speculations on high speed rail in the American context in Part 3.
						</p>
						<p><strong>HSR FOR REGIONAL GROWTH</strong><br>The
							US is a unique scenario for many reasons. One of the most important is
							geography: of all the countries with high-speed rail development, the US is
							third in land area only to Russia and China. Given the HSR “sweet spot”
							(distances between about 100–500 miles in which it is the quickest travel
							option), HSR will not be a viable solution for national travel in the US.
							Instead, it makes more sense to focus HSR development around what RPA calls “mega-regions,”
							which are territories greater than individual city boundaries with Interlocking
							economic systems, shared natural resources and ecosystems, and common
							transportation systems. This suggests a planning and governing entity at the
							scale of the region: larger than a single state, but smaller than the national
							government. With few exceptions, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and circuit courts, this
							scale of government is largely unprecedented in the US.
							<o:p></o:p>
						</p>
						<p><strong>HSR FOR A NEW URBAN RENEWAL</strong><br>In the mid-twentieth century, encouraged by the
							Federal Highway Act of 1956 and growing interest in suburban living, many cities in the US leveled
							large swaths of urban fabric to make room for highway development. Traffic congestion, noise, and
							pollution increased, neighborhoods were divided, and the pedestrian realm suffered in favor of the
							automobile. The development of HSR routes into these cities may take advantage of existing rail
							routes or chart new routes. In either case, route development shouldn’t recreate the planning
							mistakes of the past. Instead, HSR should be an opportunity to reconnect neighborhoods and improve
							the pedestrian realm. Examples such as Cordoba and Torino are precedents for tunneling existing
							rail routes and creating new urban boulevards and greenways. Roma Tiburtina station acts as a
							bridge reconnecting neighborhoods across a rail corridor. Berlin populates the space under an
							elevated rail with shops and cafes. HSR is a tool for connectivity—at the scale of the region and
							the scale of the human.
						</p>
						<p><strong>HSR FOR CONVENIENCE</strong><br>Mobility in the US is rarely easy or convenient. Highways
							are congested and transit systems (where they exist) are overcrowded. Airports are distant from
							city centers and require early arrivals of 90 to 120 minutes, invasive security protocols, and
							lengthy delays. Moreover, airline ticket prices are unpredictable, relating more to supply and
							demand than distance traveled<ins>,</ins> and prohibitively expensive when purchased on the day of
							travel.
						</p>
						<p>HSR can improve upon US mobility, but only if it is easier, quicker, and more convenient than other
							mobility options. Stations must be located inside and outside of large cities. Train fares should
							be reliable, based on distance traveled and consistently priced right up until the moment of
							departure. When possible, tickets should integrate with local metro systems and cycle rental
							facilities. On-board Wi-Fi should be quick, free, and easy to access. Cafe cars should provide
							healthy, tasty food and drink options. Ticketing should be mobile technology friendly for
							convenience. Train platforms should be easy to access from the street, and tickets should be
							checked on board to avoid circulation bottlenecks and circuitous routes. Quiet cars should be
							marked and enforced for business travel. Each train should have ample conductors to check tickets
							and provide service. Security scans should be kept as minimal as required for safety.
						</p>
						<p><strong>HSR
								FOR CONNECTIVITY
								<o:p></o:p>
							</strong><strong></strong><br>In the US there are currently several ongoing HSR projects. Some are
							still in the planning stages, such as the Houston to Dallas link in Texas. The HSR project in
							California is currently the furthest along, breaking ground in January of 2015. All of these
							projects, either public or privately developed, are benefiting from federal dollars and cooperation
							from the FRA, if not for construction then for environmental review studies and financing. But in
							each case decisions about technology for train sets, signaling, and ticketing are being made at the
							state level, not by the federal government. While this allows each state to individually negotiate
							technology packages from a variety of vendors, it does not guarantee that these systems will be
							inter-operable. It is only reasonable to predict that future systems within mega-regions will be
							fragmented and inconvenient.
						</p>
						<p>Europe, by nature of its composition of smaller but industrialized countries, has overcome this
							hurdle by ensuring certain inter-operability features, such as a standard track gauge and a
							European signaling system. High-speed trains such as the Thalys and Eurostar travel internationally
							throughout Europe because of these inter-operability standards, and a variety of companies such as
							Alstom, Bombardier, Siemens, Talgo, BREL, Hitachi and more all manufacture trains to these
							specifications. By contrast, the Shinkansen is a closed system: only Shinkansen trains can operate
							on its rails.
						</p>
						<p>Although the federal government doesn’t need to dictate a manufacturer for each project, it should
							set standards of inter-operability for HSR in the US. [Only this will assure that the US regions
							benefiting from HSR connectivity will be open to expansion, interconnectivity, and financial
							benefits, such as economy of scale.]
