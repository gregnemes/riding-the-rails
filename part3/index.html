						<p>Of all the
							territories suited to high speed rail in the United States, the flat, arid
							landscapes of Texas are among the most promising. Although the state is vast,
							much of the population is focused in just a few metropolitan regions in the
							eastern half of the state. These cities are, at their farthest, less than 200
							miles apart, which fit neatly inside the high-speed rail “sweet spot” of
							distances greater than 100 miles but less than 500 miles. The auto-dependent
							culture lends itself to considerable traffic delays, adding a significant
							amount of time to long-distance trips. Future population growth is predicted to
							be higher in cities than in suburbs, providing increased ridership potential.
							Finally, the largest cities in Texas are part of an economically co-dependent
							network often called a “Mega-Region.” Business ties are strong between these
							cities. These factors combine to make a good case for the development of high-speed
							rail.

						<p>Because of the
							economic entanglement of cities and the large expanse of the plains, Texas
							actually has a longer history with HSR than most states and has debated
							implementation since the late 1980s. At that time the state legislature
							directed the Texas Turnpike Authority to create a report outlining the
							feasibility of high speed rail service in the “Texas Triangle,” including
							Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, and Austin. The results were
							favorable and the report advised further consideration of HSR. The legislature
							followed the advice of the report and created the Texas High-Speed Rail
							Authority in 1989 to oversee and regulate high-speed rail ventures in the state
							that, by law, would be privately funded. As stated clearly in the bill,
							<strong>“It
								is not in the public interest that a high-speed rail facility be built,
								financed, or operated by the public sector."

							<figcaption>Preferred alignment for 1991 Texas TGV.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Soon after the creation of the High-Speed Rail Authority, two groups applied for franchise
							consideration: one using French TGV technology and the other using German ICE technology. The
							“Texas TGV” consortium was eventually awarded a fifty-year franchise in 1991 with their ambitious
							“T-Bone” master plan linking all the major cities in Texas. But the Texas TGV was not to be for a
							variety of reasons.
						</p>
						<p>Public sentiment turned against the technology, and Southwest Airlines (which stood to lose a
							enormous revenue from their short-haul intrastate flight services) led an aggressive campaign
							against high-speed rail. But the ultimate downfall of the Texas TGV was financing. As stated by the
							Texas Tribune, “Some 70 percent of the project’s $6 billion price tag would be provided via
							tax-exempt private activity bonds, more than federal law allowed a company to borrow using that
							type of financing. The venture hinged on Texas TGV changing federal law to ease the restrictions.”
							Although a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) had already been completed including ridership
							studies suggesting a private franchise could be solvent within a few years of operation, the
							franchise was revoked when it became clear that federal law would not be changed and other
							financing was not available for the project. A year later the state abolished the Texas High-Speed
							Rail Authority and its functions were not absorbed by any other state agency. In Texas, high-speed
							rail was dead.

						<p>The national vision in and around Texas includes a generous corridor that extends from Tulsa to San
							Antonio, and another along the gulf coast from Houston to New Orleans. Both federal bills include
							grant funding for planning and development work: the ARRA budgeted 8 billion for intercity
							passenger initiatives, with priority for high speed rail projects in the designated corridors
							outlined by the national Vision for High Speed Rail. By 2010, the nation had both a vision and a
							funding mechanism for planning and corridor development.
						</p>
						<p>As a result of past
							interest in high-speed rail and new federal funding opportunities, Texas has
							both public and private organizations working on three separate corridor studies
							for HSR. In 2011 the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) was awarded a
							$15 million ARRA grant for preliminary engineering and NEPA studies for
							high-speed rail between Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston. (NEPA is a process of
							fact gathering, alternatives evaluation, and public outreach that results in an
							Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Record of Decision (ROD), which
							allows an infrastructure project to be developed.) In 2012, a private group
							called Texas Central Railway (TCR) made a proposal to TxDOT to study and
							develop only the Dallas-Houston portion of the corridor. TCR is a consortium of
							private investors working with Central Japan Rail towards incorporation of
							proprietary Japanese Shinkansen technology, and has emphasized that they intend
							to develop the corridor using only private funds. As such, a division of labor
							was created in which the FRA and a private consultant, with support from TxDOT
							and TCR, are leading the NEPA process on the Dallas-Houston corridor as a
							stand-alone project. To date, they have been successful through several stages
							of the NEPA process and a draft EIS is expected in 2016.

							Rail Study (TOPRS), which includes an 850-mile corridor from Oklahoma City to
							South Texas via Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, and a few other cities. This
							study is scheduled to conclude by the end of 2016 after the completion of a

						</p>
						<p>Texas is a good case study for this research project because it offers conditions similar to the
							rest of the US, as well as idiosyncratic conditions specific to Texas.
						</p>
						<p>Like most US regions, population density in all of the major cities is much lower than a typical
							European or Asian city. Diffusive urban organizations such as suburbs and edge cities are much more
							common than dense patterns of development, and driving into the city to catch a train is just as
							inconvenient as driving to the airport. Public transit is much less comprehensive, so getting
							around upon arrival by high-speed train is a challenge. There is already evidence of general
							NIMBYism towards the existing HSR studies, an unfortunate cultural tendency prevalent throughout
							the US. Then there are real and perceived cultural hurdles, such as the notion that Americans are
							just too automobile-centric to take the train.
						</p>
						<p>Unique to Texas (and
							to some extent other politically conservative states) is the notion that the
							private sector should have a leading role in development. It is not uncommon
							for the private sector to have a major role in the development of bridges,
							highways, and other infrastructure that, in other states, is provided by the
							public sector. In fact the 1989 bill that created the first Texas High-Speed
							Rail Authority clearly stated,
							<strong>“It is not in the public interest that a
								high-speed rail facility be built, financed, or operated by the public sector.”
							</strong>If America is to construct an effective high-speed rail network, as I think
							it should, then these general and specific hurdles have to be addressed. The
							following speculations use information available from TxDOT, the FRA, and TCR,
							in combination with the research conducted in Parts 1 and 2, to speculate about
							the implementation of High-Speed Rail in Texas.

						<p>Although Texas has
							three HSR projects undergoing the NEPA process, the Dallas–Houston corridor
							being studied by Texas Central Railway, a private sector group, is the closest
							to becoming a reality. As an initial step TCR identified four general corridor
							options for review by the FRA, which identified one of those options as a
							viable solution. Next, TCR identified several specific alignment options within
							the viable corridor for review, as well as several station location options for
							Dallas and Houston. Because TCR is a private company, naturally the primary
							goal for design, construction, and operation of the line is ultimately a return
							on investment. The preferred station location in Dallas reflects the goal of
							profitability: a site at the edge of downtown on a vast greenfield for ease of
							station construction and the potential development of complementary uses.

						<p>As the previous
							research has shown, train stations have an incredible potential to create rich,
							vibrant, and diverse hubs of activity. Along with appropriate private and
							public investment, a train station can catalyze a new urban center, a new
							suburban center, or even help regenerate part of an existing city. It is an
							opportunity to correct the urban divisions created by the railroad in past
							centuries with innovative urban design and architecture. As cited by Amtrak,
							<strong>“A
								well-planned train station is one of the best investments a community can make
								as it seeks to expand its appeal as a place for tourism and business investment
								and also cultivate civic pride.”
							</strong> With so much potential civic benefit on
							the line, it is imperative that non-market driven factors are included in the
							decision making process for alignments, station locations, and HSR technology
							selection. The following provocations on station location in Dallas privilege
							civic goals and the common good in the station location process.
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>PROVOCATION #1</h4>
						<h3>Urban Periphery//A look at Central Texas Railway’s Preferred Location</h3>
						<p><em>[[gallery id="32"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p><strong></strong>Given the complexity
							of locating new high-speed rail stations in dense urban environments, sites on
							the edges of existing cities are sometimes selected for station development.
							Recent examples include: Albacete in Spain, Avignon TGV in France, and Sudkreuz
							Station in Germany. These sites usually offer larger developable parcels (for
							parking and complementary uses) as well as less complex construction scenarios
							for the station and rail approach. The trade-off, however, is connectivity,
							because these sites are not easily accessed from the city or surrounding
							neighborhoods.
							<strong>Stations at the urban periphery should be designed with a
								robust urban framework, an appropriate mix of land uses, thoughtful
								consideration of site challenges, and excellent public transit connectivity.
							</strong>
							When successful, these types of sites have the potential to develop into viable
							neighborhoods or new urban centers. When unsuccessful, a station will feel
							isolated from the city, will experience low ridership, and will fail to
							generate any meaningful development in the surrounding area.
						</p>
						<p>The location
							preferred by Texas Central is currently isolated by large-scale infrastructure:
							the I-30/I-35 canyon to the northwest, a railroad corridor to the northeast,
							and the future Trinity River toll road to the southwest. The key to successful
							development at this site in Dallas will lie in establishing good connections to
							existing public transit, to the Trinity River, to the Cedars neighborhood, and
							to the convention center.
						</p>
						<h4><br></h4>
						<h4>Provocation #2</h4>
						<h3>Urban Core
						</h3>
						<p><em>[[gallery id="33"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p>Like many American cities, Dallas is currently experiencing an urban revival. The city has made
							serious investments in a new light-rail network, streetscape improvements, and the pedestrian
							realm. The Arts District is flourishing with many new amenities. Connections to surrounding
							neighborhoods outside of the inner freeway loop have been planned and are beginning to take shape,
							starting with Klyde Warren Park, which creates a pedestrian bridge from the Arts District to Uptown
							across Woodall Rodgers Freeway. Private development is continually contributing new residential and
							commercial projects, and substantial urban growth in employment and population is expected by 2030.
							Dallas is becoming a diverse and vibrant city as a direct result of both public and private
							investment in the built environment.
						</p>
						<p>Still, with all these improvements and momentum, there remain several pockets in the urban core
							with block after block of surface parking lots ripe for development. A new high-speed rail station
							located in the center of town would catalyze dense infill development within the inner loop.
							Routing the high-speed rail alignment through the center of the city would be costly, requiring
							tunneling under city streets. Yet the economic impact of new development in the center of town
							would benefit a wider variety of businesses, residents, and property owners than the individually
							owned peripheral site preferred by TCR. The connection to light rail and long-distance buses would
							be more convenient, and a properly sited station could activate the existing tunnel network and
							provide momentum for a better pedestrian connection with the Deep Ellum neighborhood.
						</p>
						<p>The impetus for this
							provocation is two-fold. First, that the civic benefits of a new high-speed
							rail station should be harnessed to create a more vibrant city center,
							privileging dispersed economic benefit and sustainable urban infill development
							over peripheral greenfield development. Second, that train stations have a
							unique ability to create a central hub of activity and to catalyze private
							complementary development within walking distance. US cities are experiencing a
							revival, but most still need considerable investment to achieve a successfully
							dense mix of uses.
							<strong>The opportunity to harness the “centering” ability of
								stations shouldn't be overlooked. It warrants substantial public consideration
								and, though not traditional in Texas, substantial public investment.
							</strong>Case
							studies for this type of project include Cordoba Station in Spain, Porta Susa
							Station in Italy, and Part-Dieu TGV Station in France.

						<h3>Suburban/Urban Combo<br>
						</h3>
						<p><em>[[gallery id="34"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p>Most important European and Asian cities have high population densities because people there live
							in cities more commonly than in suburbs. As such, trains that zip along from city center to city
							center are easily accessible for most passengers. In America, even in major cities, a substantial
							portion of the population lives outside the city center, in suburbs and “edge cities.” Although
							recently millennials and empty-nesters have been bolstering urban populations, in America the
							suburbs are here to stay. An essential task of American high-speed rail will be to balance the
							needs of urban and suburban passengers. It is illogical for a suburbanite to fight traffic all the
							way downtown, just to board a train headed back out of the city. Moreover, huge parking garages are
							not the highest and best use for urban property. (We won’t be able to get rid of all the parking,
							but our cities will be richer, experientially and in terms of tax dollars, when urban land can be
							preserved for commercial and residential uses.)
						</p>
						<p>There are examples
							in Europe and Asia where a suburban high-speed rail station complements a main
							urban station. The two stations work as a pair, serving a greater range of
							passengers more efficiently than either station alone. At the urban station,
							parking is provided at nearby garages, while the station real estate itself is
							reserved for shopping, dining, passenger services, and sometimes added
							amenities like hotels or concert halls. These suburban stations are easily
							accessible by highway, offer plenty of parking, car rental, and connection to
							the greater region by public transit on bus or light rail. The high-speed rail
							tracks might be shared with high-speed commuter services, such as southeastern
							commuter service in the UK, or the right of way might be shared with
							conventional commuter rail on separate tracks.
						</p>
						<p>In Dallas, sharing
							the HSR right-of-way with a new light-rail route will have the added benefit of
							addressing important equity issues. The alignment passes through a
							predominantly non-white area of south Dallas that is also devoid of public
							transit and employment opportunities. A new light rail will connect residents
							with the employment rich areas of Dallas north of the city and take more cars
							off the freeways. As the birthplace of both suburbs and skyscrapers, America is
							fundamentally a place of mixed development patterns. The challenge will be to
							provide service to both.

						<h3>Scales of Planning</h3>
						<p>In the United States
							and across the world, urban development over the last century has been
							characterized by processes of spatial, cultural, technological, and economic
							convergence known as globalization. Economies, ideas, and relationships have
							become more interconnected and interdependent within a social space no longer
							bound by the limits of distance. As early as 1910, Patrick Geddes coined the
							term “megalopolis” to describe a pattern of development in which the growth of
							relatively proximate cities causes them to merge and form urban agglomerations.
							Considered as a single entity, a megalopolis or mega-region is a polycentric
							organization of networked individual cities. An excerpt from “The Rise of the
							Mega-Region” describes further:

						<p><em>[Mega-regions] perform functions that are somewhat similar to those of the great cities of the
								past—massing together talent, productive capability, innovation and markets. But they do this on
								a far larger scale. Furthermore, while cities in the past were part of national systems,
								globalization has exposed them to world-wide competition. As the distribution of economic
								activity has gone global, the city-system has also become global—meaning that cities compete now
								on a global terrain. Urban mega-regions are coming to relate to the global economy in much the
								same way that metropolitan regions relate to national economies[...]Mega-regions are more than
								just a bigger version of a city or a metropolitan region. As a city is composed of separate
								neighborhoods, and as a metropolitan region is made up of a central city and its suburbs, a
								mega-region is a polycentric agglomeration of cities and their lower-density hinterlands. It
								represents the new, natural economic unit that emerges as metropolitan regions not only grow
								upward and become denser but also grow outward and into one another. Just as a city is not
								simply a large neighborhood, a mega-region is not simply a large city—it is an ‘emergent’ entity
								with characteristics that are qualitatively different from those of its constituent cities.</em>
						</p>
						<p>This urban formation
							is directly related to advances in mobility technology, such as the high-speed
							train and the jet, and communications technology, such as the Internet and the
							proliferation of computers and smartphones, which provide for effective
							time-space compression. This pattern of urban development is growing. In the
							late twentieth century geographer Jean Gottman identified twenty-five such
							urban agglomerations across the world. Later, researchers utilizing global
							nighttime light emissions and other datasets predicted forty mega-regions with
							economic output of more than $100 billion that produce 66% of world output and
							account for 85 percent of global innovation.
						</p>
						<p><em>[[slider id="31"]]</em><br>
						</p>
						<p>With federal
							legislation such as the PRIAA of 2008 and the ARRA of 2009 that encourage
							development of high-speed rail, the United States has taken an important step
							towards meeting the infrastructure needs of the twenty-first century. What is
							missing is a recognition of the mega-region in which high speed rail is
							applicable. Traditional scales of planning operate at the local, state, and
							national levels, but mega-regions exist in a scale above the boundaries of
							state planning, and below the efficacy of federal visioning. RPA has identified
							eleven distinct mega-regions in the United States, and Texas forms part of two:
							the “Texas Triangle,” which effectively extends into Oklahoma, and the “Gulf
							Coast,” which extends into Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
						</p>
						<p>In recognition of
							the critical importance of the mega-region as a competitive economic unit, the
							federal government should create official planning agencies for each
							mega-region. These entities would work with each city in the network to create
							and implement a plan for economic development of the region along with
							transportation and infrastructure. In this way high-speed rail would be
							developed to promote accessibility to the entire region. (A domestic precedent
							for this type of agency is the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), while an
							international example is the European Union’s European Spatial Development
							Program (EDSP).) Private developers would have an important role to play, but
							within a larger planning framework that balances bottom line profit with the
							needs of the mega-region communities.

						<h3>Public vs Private Development<br>
						</h3>
						<p>In Texas the private
							sector has an established role as a developer of public infrastructure. In
							Dallas alone several toll roads have been privately developed and the
							construction of a few bridges involved substantial private sector funding as
							well. Currently the highly contested Trinity Toll Road is a private development
							initiative. So in Texas it's not a question of
							<i>if</i> the private sector should be involved in high-speed rail
							development, so much as
							<i>how</i>. There
							are many examples of private sector involvement in high-speed and conventional
							rail in Europe and Asia. In 1991 the EU directed reform in the structure of
							national railways such that operations would be separated from the development
							and maintenance of infrastructure. This allows system growth to be directed by
							national and EU planning agencies, while also providing for healthy competition
							in operations. Services such as Eurostar, Thalys, Thello, Italo, Virgin, and
							many more operate internationally and compete with national trains such as the
							Spanish AVE, French TGV, and German ICE trains. Station and station area
							development has been leveraged with private investment: in Spain, private firm
							Vialia has worked with Adif to develop stations as shopping destinations, and
							in France, SNC partnered with private companies Klépierre and Spie Batignolles
							Immobilier to renovate Saint Lazare station and convert more than 100,000
							square feet into eighty retail spaces.
						</p>
						<p>In order for Europe
							to create a network traversable by trains across national borders,
							standardization and interoperability have been of utmost importance. Rail gauge
							(the distance between rails on the tracks) has been standardized at 4 feet 8 1/2
							inches, and trains are designed to accommodate a variety of signaling
							technologies. For example, Thalys international high-speed trains (which
							connect Paris, Brussels, Cologne, and Amsterdam) are equipped with a minimum of
							seven different signaling systems for cross-border operation. Japanese
							Shinkansen technology, on the other hand, is not designed to accommodate or be
							interchangeable with other types of trains. Both European and Japanese
							technologies are safe and reliable.
							<strong>The public sector therefore needs to be
								involved in irreversible decisions about technology, because they affect the
								ability of the future system to be accessible by multiple operators.
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p><span style="line-height: 1.9;"></span>The Texas state
							legislature has embedded this statement into law, “It is not in the public
							interest that a high-speed rail facility be built, financed, or operated by the
							public sector.” This sentiment is shortsighted and ignores the enormous
							benefits, to the community, of public/private development. High-speed rail
							development should be aligned with American ideals of entrepreneurship,
							equality, and accessibility, and as such the private sector has an important
							role to play. But development of the system shouldn’t be seen as a burden on
							the people. Rather, it should be seen as a public good, a tool to focus public
							and private investment to create better cities, and a better network of cities
							within the mega-region. Barring the public from involvement in planning and
							development will limit the advantage of Texas HSR to a small cohort of
							investors, in the form of profits, and restrict the potential for healthy,
							dense, more vibrant city centers that benefit the community broadly. The difference
							between the two is the difference between limited augmentation and revitalizing
							transformation.
