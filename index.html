					<p><strong>Emeryville, California<br>Summer, 2014</strong>
					</p>
					<p>I’m waiting on a train.
					</p>
					<p>It’s a
						clear morning and surprisingly cool. My backpack is heavy on my shoulders. The
						difficulty of packing for a train trip around the world bewildered me for weeks,
						but I managed to trim my belongings down to a single bag. The station in
						Emeryville is a modest brick structure, set back from the street by a handful
						of parking spaces and a porte cochère. The building is really just a large waiting
						room with a ticket counter, although inside the combination of tall ceilings,
						polished laminate flooring, and crisp California sunshine are welcoming enough. While
						not exactly crowded, the room is bright and buzzing with excitement. I stand
						off to the side, leaning my shoulder against the wall near the large windows so
						I can keep an eye on the platform and also watch life play itself out between
						the rows of seats in front of me. From my spot I can see men and women
						traveling for business, and families wrangling young children while also trying
						to fold up strollers and check luggage. Behind me a cyclist in full road gear
						argues with an attendant about the cost of bicycle carriage. Outside, on the
						platform, large cameras dangle from the necks of tourists as they pace around,
						anxious for the train to arrive.
						<o:p></o:p>
					</p>
					<p> [[slider id="1"]]
					</p>
					<p>Despite it’s small size, Emeryville station is host to four of California’s eight Amtrak routes: the
						Coast Starlight to Seattle, the San Joaquin central valley route, the Capital Corridor to San Jose and
						Sacramento, and the route for which I have a ticket: the California Zephyr to Chicago. In theory, the
						Zephyr would take me across the country, a distance of just under 2500 miles, in approximately fifty
						hours. (When the train debuted in 1949, the trip duration was two hours shorter.) The time of
						departure printed on the front of my ticket has now come and gone without acknowledgement from the
						desk staff. Either they are too busy to notice, they don’t care, or they don’t consider a delayed
						train unusual enough to mention.
					</p>
					<figure data-type="quote" class="wy-figure-small wy-figure-left">
						<blockquote>Either they are too busy to notice, they don’t care, or they don’t consider a delayed
							train unusual enough to mention.<br>

						</blockquote>
					</figure>
					<p>I wander out to the platform just in time to catch the big stainless steel locomotive of the Zephyr
						rumble passed, smelling of diesel and halting all conversations. All of a sudden, everyone is in the
						way of everyone else. Cameras flash away at the double decker train as passengers scurry about the
						platform, anxiously searching their pockets for tickets or posing for photos. I splurged on a passage
						in a superliner roomette, Amtrak’s economy sleeper cabin, and my own ticket indicates I am in car
						0630, cabin 07. My anticipation for a private room grows in direct proportion to the increasing
						cacophony of rolling luggage all around me. I scan the train as it slowly comes to a halt and try to
						locate my car along the sun-washed platform.
					</p>
					<p>As I walk, I see conductors checking tickets at each entrance. But when I reach my designated car, I
						find an elderly couple standing awkwardly outside a train car door that isn’t thrown open like the
						others. Our conductor isn’t anywhere in sight, and the couple is hesitant to enter the train without a
						ticket check. We wait another few moments, joined by four Chinese tourists and a woman on crutches
						with a cast. We decide as a group, mostly through shrugs and hand gestures, to open the door and board
						the train without the approval of a conductor.
					</p>
					<p> [[slider id="2"]]
					</p>
					<p>Even though the Zephyr arrives late and I am welcomed on board by no one, cabin 07 on the upper level
						delights me. From the narrow interior corridor, I slide the pocket door aside to find two cushy
						reclining seats facing each other in front of a big picture window. The door is flanked by an
						eight-inch-deep shelf stuffed full of clean towels and a tiny closet with two clothes hangers. I look
						up to see a bunk bed, complete with sheets and blankets, that is folded away for the day. A bottle of
						water and a clean pillow wait near my seat, and a small pamphlet informs me that showers are located
						on the car’s lower level. Overall, the entire roomette measures just 42" x 78". The petite size is
						efficient; the privacy is luxurious. <strong>Combined with the latent romance of train travel, the
							quiet calm of the roomette makes my familiar country seem new and
							exciting.</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>

						<blockquote>The act of riding a train in the United States is an act of nostalgia. It’s a look to the

							that promotes speed and efficiency above most other qualities.

						</blockquote>
					</figure>
					<p><strong></strong><strong>Over the next two days I encounter delight and frustration in equal
							measure.</strong> I meet and have conversations with interesting characters: I talk urban design
						with a community organizer from Nevada and debate the second amendment with a soft-spoken woman from
						Texas (whom I’m pretty sure had a handgun in her purse). There are more Amish people than I’ve ever
						seen in one place—word on the train is that they travel to Mexico for healthcare procedures that are
						too expensive in the States. The winding route of the train through the Rockies is truly breathtaking,
						and it is fun to ‘oooh’ and ‘aaah’ with the other passengers. Park rangers board the lounge car and
						recount the history of the California landscape as we roll through the state, highlighting events such
						as the Gold Rush, the pounding of the final golden spike of the transcontinental railroad at
						Promontory Point, and even cannibalism at Donner Pass. The presence of the park rangers makes one
						thing clear: the act of riding a train in the United States is an act of nostalgia. It’s a look to the
						past. It’s a choice to dine with strangers, to travel slowly, a counter-choice to a global culture
						that promotes speed and efficiency above most other qualities. This, ironically, is an attitude
						founded in large part by the then-revolutionary speed of the locomotive in the 19th century. In human
						experience, speed is relative.

					<p>But the Zephyr also makes unexplained stops for long periods as freight trains roll by. Meals are a
						hectic affair involving reservations, and the dining car is mysteriously out of key food items even at
						the first meal. Coffee is supposed to be available all day in each sleeper car, yet in car 0630 the
						urn remains stubbornly unplugged and empty. The showers run out of water on morning two; the bathrooms
						are miserable by the end of the trip; we are five hours late to Chicago; no one seems to know why my
						car has no conductor (even though clearly the other staff are annoyed by this as well).

					<p><strong></strong><strong>It’s easy to love train travel</strong>: the stress of driving and navigating
						melts as the landscape stretches out beyond the window, sliding passed my idle gaze from left to
						right. Passed seasides, over mountains, and through farmlands and deserts, the train rumbles onward
						rocking gently from side to side. Time passes more slowly than usual. The seats are spacious and there
						are train cars dedicated to lounging, taking in the scenery, and dining. Children get discounted
						tickets, and there is ample barrier-free access. You can bring almost as much luggage as you want, and
						you don’t have to arrive two hours early or take your shoes off for a TSA pat-down. Trains offer
						unique and memorable spatial experiences and encourage travelers to interact. Nobody falls in love on
						a plane; there isn’t enough room. But mingling is a core activity of train travel: the space and
						social atmosphere provide ample opportunity for a chance encounter with a stranger.
					</p>
					<p> [[slider id="4"]]
					</p>
					<p><strong></strong><strong>It’s harder to love Amtrak</strong>, which is the only means of medium and
						long distance train travel in America. Since 1970, when Amtrak was created by Congress to remove the
						burden of passenger travel from large freight operators, the company has been systemically
						underfunded, undervalued, and under-prioritized by Washington, DC. After traveling more than 10,000
						miles on nearly all of Amtrak’s long distance service over the past three years, I truly believe it
						does the best it can with aging rolling stock, crumbling infrastructure, and meager operating budgets.
						Still, Amtrak is broken, and given the size of the country and the dominance of American auto and
						airline industries, it seems unlikely to be fixed without both political will and a grand national
						vision supported by the people. But since Amtrak is all most Americans know about train travel,
						garnering the needed support is challenging. <strong>Nobody supports a broken train system.</strong>

					<p><strong></strong><strong>Unlike the United States, riding a train in most other countries
						</strong><strong>is liberating.</strong> Travel is brisk, stations are attractive and clean, and
						trains are well attended and comfortable. Japan introduced the first high-speed train from Tokyo to
						Osaka in 1964, and since then speeds have increased and high-speed rail (HSR) technology has been
						adopted by industrialized countries throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Train travel there
						is more environmentally friendly, more convenient, and more comfortable than budget air travel. Trains
						are the preferred mode of transit for distances between 75-500 miles in countries where it is
						available, because, at nearly 200mph, it is quicker than cars and more convenient than planes.
						Technology aside, trains shape the social space of cities. Whether historic, renovated, or brand new,
						train stations are the nexus of urban culture and commerce, the heartbeat generating and regenerating
						a vibrant urban community.<br>

					<p><strong></strong><strong>Despite the broken condition of Amtrak, train travel could make a comeback in
							the US.</strong> American highways are congested and crumbling, daily commute times are inhumane,
						and many airports are at maximum capacity. Citizens are ever more aware of the environmental damage
						caused by carbon emissions from cars and planes. And, in a migratory ‘about face,’ Americans are now
						moving into cities instead of out of them. As such, there is renewed interest in all forms of transit.
						In 2009, as a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Obama administration designated
						over $8 billion towards high-speed rail initiatives, and unveiled a ‘Vision for High-Speed Rail in
						America.’ Following the announcement, forty states and the District of Columbia requested over $100
						billion for high-speed train projects. The demand, at least for studying high-speed rail, is there. In
						January of 2015, California <a
							href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/01/05/california-to-break-ground-on-68-billion-high-speed-rail-line/">broke
							ground</a> on its own high-speed route, largely along the San Joaquin corridor through the valley,
						to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles. In Florida, a high-speed rail project connecting Tampa and
						Orlando started but was disappointingly shelved in 2014. And in Texas, a group of investors is making
						progress towards a <a href="https://youtu.be/fh4Wb0jqoBc">privately funded route</a> between Dallas
						and Houston. If, <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Speed_Ground_Transportation_Act_of_1965">after fifty years
							of stalling</a>, Americans are finally ready to address the problem of mobility in the US, we must
						look outside of our own the traditional transportation planning processes that are still dominated by
						the tools, methods and assumptions, political biases, procedural failures, and instilled human
						behaviors of our past and current planning processes
					</p>
					<p>[[gallery id="5"]]
					</p>
					<p>In order to accomplish this, designers need to reconnect with the rich spatial legacy of the train in
						nineteenth century America and understand the physical implications of 21st century high-speed trains.
						Using travel as a lens of inquiry, <strong>Riding the Rails</strong> explores the physical
						implications of the railroad in the past, present and future at several scales of intervention and in
						a variety of cultural contexts. Drawing from first-hand train passage throughout Europe and Asia, the
						resulting body of research establishes a platform from which to speculate on new models of American
						urbanization in the age of high-speed rail.

								Restlessness</strong></a> explores the implications of the railroad on the physical development
						of a young and expansive United States from the early nineteenth century to World War II. During this
						period, the railroad galvanized an American spirit of entrepreneurship, progress, and technological
						determinism towards an urbanism specific to its own physical and temporal parameters. The train, its
						station, and its routes produced an urbanism distinct from that produced by a jet and an airport, or
						even by a car and a highway. While these other mobility technologies would inform American urbanism in
						the twentieth century, it was the train that ushered modernity into the physical, economic, social and
						cultural DNA of the country well before the car and the plane and in ways that the American collective
						memory has forgotten. As Tom Zoellner states, "Under the skin of modernity lies a skeleton of railroad
						tracks."
					</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.ridingtherails.org/part2"><strong>Part 2: Waiting on a Train</strong></a> focuses
						on the contemporary physical implications of high-speed Rail from World War II to the present day,
						using case studies from Europe and Asia to identify the new and exciting ways in which HSR invents new
						architectural and urban typologies, compresses space, and opens up new operative scales that supersede
						traditional scales of design and planning. Throughout history, transportation technologies don’t
						usually make a comeback and, in this way too, high-speed rail is unique. Beginning with Japan in the
						1960s, carried on by France and Germany throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s, and implemented most
						recently by Spain, China, and South Korea, high-speed rail has had profound multi-scalar physical
						implications on both cities and suburbs. But this new technology has not simply reproduced the
						typological innovations of the past; it’s not as simple as replacing a slow train with a fast train.
						The unprecedented speed of these new trains compresses space in new and exciting ways. Distance is no
						longer measured in miles but in minutes, and in this way high-speed rail opens up new operative scales
						for design and planning. In addition to the effectiveness of high-speed technology is its
						affectiveness: trains offer an experience of travel that is distinct from, and arguably superior to,
						most other modes of travel.
					</p>
					<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.ridingtherails.org/part3"><strong>Part 3: I Hear that Train
								A-comin’</strong></a> speculates
						on the future of passenger rail in America, which, due to the dominance of the car, is a challenging
						environment for high-speed rail. The population density in all of the major cities is much lower than
						a typical European or Asian city. Diffusive urban organizations such as suburbs and edge cities are
						much more common than dense patterns of development, and driving into the city to catch a train is
						just as inconvenient as driving to the airport. Public transit is much less comprehensive, so getting
						around upon arrival by high speed train is a challenge. There is already evidence of general NIMBYism
						towards the existing HSR studies, a cultural tendency increasingly prevalent throughout the US. Then
						there are real and perceived cultural hurdles, specifically the notion that Americans are just too
						automobile-centric to take the train. This section focuses on Texas as a case study for speculation
						and provocation, with expanded lessons to be learned for other states.
